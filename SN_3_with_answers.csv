By measuring current and voltage, the resistance and energy can also be recorded, controlled and accurately evaluated during welding. The adaptive control algorithm ensures consistent quality and reduces spatter in demanding weld- ing applications.

The equipment used in the spot welding process consists of tool holders and electrodes. The tool holders function as a mechanism to hold the electrodes firmly in place and also A spot welding robot support optional water hoses that cool the electrodes during welding. Tool holding methods include a paddle-type, light duty, universal, and regular offset. The electrodes generally are made of a low resistance alloy, usually copper, and are designed in many different shapes and sizes depending on the application needed. The two materials being welded together are known as the workpieces and must conduct electricity. The width of the workpieces is limited by the throat length of the welding apparatus and ranges typically from 5 to 50 inches (13 to 130 cm). Workpiece thickness can range from 0.008 to 17/05/2023, 10:59 1.25 inches (0.20 to 32 mm).[5] After the current is removed from the workpiece, it is cooled via...\\n\\nFILENAME: External - Spot welding.pdf\\nTITLE: Characteristics\\n...low as 1 V at the end of the weld. This decrease in voltage results from the reduction in resistance caused by the workpiece melting. The open circuit voltage from the transformer is higher than this, typically in the 5 to 22 volt range.[13] The resistance of the weld spot changes as it flows and liquefies. Modern welding equipment can monitor and adjust the weld in real time to ensure a consistent weld. The equipment may seek to control different variables during the weld, such as current, voltage, power, or energy. Welder sizes range from 5 to 500 kVA.[14] Micro spot welders, used in a variety of industries, can go down to 1.5 kVA or less for precision welding needs. It is common for a spray of molten metal droplets (sparks) to be ejected from the area of the weld during the process. Resistance spot welding generates no bright arc, so UV protection is not required. OSHA requires transparent face shields or goggles for splatter protection, but does not require any filter lens.[15]\\n\\nFILENAME: External - Spot welding.pdf\\nHIERARCHY: Spot welding\\nTITLE: Spot welding\\nSpot welding Spot welding (or resistance spot welding[1]) is a type of electric resistance welding used to weld various sheet metal products, through a process in which contacting metal surface points are joined by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current. The process uses two shaped copper alloy electrodes to concentrate welding current into a small \\""spot\\"" and to simultaneously clamp the sheets together. Work-pieces are A spot welder held together under pressure exerted by electrodes. Typically the sheets are in the 0.5 to 3 mm (0.020 to 0.118 in) thickness range. Forcing a large current through the spot will melt the metal and form the weld. The attractive feature of spot welding is that a large amount of energy can be delivered to the spot in a very short time (approximately 10Ã¯Â¿Â½100 milliseconds).[2] This permits the welding to occur without excessive heating of the remainder of the sheet. The amount of heat (energy) delivered to the spot is determined by the...']","Resistance spot welding (or spot welding) is a type of electric resistance welding used to join various sheet metal products.
