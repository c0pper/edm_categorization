Work also includes rehabilitating the viewing platform, replacing all directional and informational signage, and rehabilitating the visitor viewing area around the falls. New retaining walls will be installed to prevent erosion, and areas degraded by high visitor traffic will be restored and native vegetation replanted. Existing visitor viewing areas will be rehabilitated and new viewing locations will be evaluated and added as required.This project includes new and rehabilitated parking areas along the Fighting Creek Gap Road between the Elkmont Campground Entrance Road and Maloney Point. Work includes removing the existing surface, rehabilitating existing parking areas, and constructing new parking areas.

The use of incorrect or defective material would create a high probability of failure resulting in serious personnel injury, loss of life, loss of vital shipboard systems, or loss of the ship itself.  Therefore, the material has been designated as SPECIAL EMPHASIS material (Level I, Scope of Certification, or Quality Assured) and special control procedures are invoked to ensure receipt of correct material. 2.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 2.1  Order of Precedence - In the event of a conflict between the text of this contract/purchase order and the references and/or drawings cited herein, the text of this contract/purchase order must take precedence.

To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a nontraditional, proactive, and product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising therapeutic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The full suite of services, of which the services in this solicitation are a part, will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of interventional products for infectious disease required for New Drug Application (NDA), Biologic License Applications (BLA) and/or Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Consequently, NIAID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, or consultants. Chemistry underpins all stages of product development by providing the materials required at each stage of development for studies supporting advancement to the next stage of development. The Interventional Agents Chemistry Services resource is intended for case-by-case support of diverse interventional agent product candidates rather than for carrying a single program through multiple stages of the preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a large number and variety of investigators to obtain critical data needed to attract additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support clinical trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete necessary studies to satisfy regulatory requirements. Investigators work with NIAID program officers to access the services through an online request portal. Through these interactions the program officers develop requirements in conjunction with the investigators that reflect the program development needs at the time. These requirements become the basis of the Statement of Work (SOW) of a Request for Task Order Proposal (RTOP) which is issued as a solicitation to all awardees (the contractor \u201cpool\u201d) of the Task Area to which the RTOP is issued. Contractors in the pool then submit technical and cost proposals against the work in the RTOP and these proposals are evaluated by the responsible NIAID staff. The proposal determined to be the best value to the government is awarded, provided funds are available. Contractors in the pool are not involved in the development of the requirements, however, they may receive inquiries from the Contracting Officer (CO), in the form of a Request for Information (RFI) in regard to technical capabilities in some cases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this contract an Interventional Agent is a chemical or biological agent for control of an infectious disease caused by a pathogen or toxin (e.g., botulinum toxin). The provided services shall be directed at the following: Diseases caused by pathogens and toxins on the NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens list (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens) Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Antimicrobial resistant and multi-drug resistant infections Other bacterial infections Fungal infections Viral infections Parasitic diseases. NIAID anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to organizations that demonstrate capability to fulfill the technical requirements of at least one (1) of the technical Task Areas listed below plus required Task Area A. A contract may be awarded to an organization proposing to fulfill either or both of the technical Task Areas plus Task Area A. The Government anticipates making awards to those organizations with the best qualifications in each Task Area. Subpar evaluation in one technical Task Area will not exclude the organization from or negatively impact consideration for award in another Task Area. Organizations will be considered for contracts only in the Task Area(s) they include in the proposal. Task areas and the scope of each are as follows: Task Area A \u2013 Contract Kick-Off Meeting Task Area A will support the planning and participating in the parent contract kick-off meeting. Task Area B \u2013 Non-GMP Chemistry Task Area B will support activities required for the route optimization, process development, and synthesis of a synthetic intermediate, lead, or preclinical candidate, and may include acquisition or purchase of compounds from a third-party source, such as a commercial vendor. Activities under this Task Area include technology transfer of synthesis schemes and procedures between third party facilities and contractors as specified in each Task Order. Task Area C \u2013 GMP Manufacturing, Formulation, Fill and Finish Task Area C will support the formulation development for clinical or advanced preclinical studies; current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant synthesis of Drug Substance (DS), cGMP-compliant manufacturing of Drug Product (DP) consistent with relevant FDA guidelines; provision of all required documentation including documentation required for IND filing; product release testing required for human clinical use; and DP stability testing required during clinical trials. The Contractor shall be responsible for directing and ensuring the successful technology transfer of all materials, assays, methods and procedures as required for the successful performance of the activities.

The commissioned service is aligned to the Partnership\u2019s Advocacy Strategy (2023 \u2013 2026). Fife\u2019s Advocacy Strategy 2023-2026 sets out the commitment to the provision of independent advocacy services in Fife and to improving awareness of access to services to ensure the best outcomes for people who are unable to speak up for themselves. Fife Health and Social Care Partnership recognises the importance of advocacy in: -Empowering people to access information, express their own needs, explore options and make their own, informed decisions. -Ensuring that people\u2019s rights are not infringed and making it easier for people to exercise those rights and have their voice heard when decisions are being made about their care. -Ensuring a safeguard for people who may be at risk of being treated unfairly due to circumstances that make them vulnerable. Priority will be given to those individuals for whom the Partnership has a statutory duty to provide access to an independent advocacy service and for whom Scottish Government policy, guidance and standards gives precedence. Aims of the Service: - -Professional advocacy will be provided to vulnerable people, aged 16 and over, who are affected by disability, chronic illness or mental disorder, and who are unable to safeguard their own well-being, rights, care or other interests. -Those eligible to receive this service specifically, but not exclusively, includes people with mental health issues, learning disabilities, personality disorder, physical disabilities, acquired brain injury, dementia and autistic spectrum disorders, as well as chronic illness. -Professional advocacy will also be provided to children under 16 years who are subject to compulsory measures under the Mental Health (Care & Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, or are the subject of a Welfare Guardianship application, under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. -A collective advocacy service will be provided for specific groups, where there is an identified need. This will be negotiated with the service provider with consideration of available resources. The current Advocacy Contract in place requires provision of professional advocacy for a minimum of 950 issues per year. The minimum number of issues which will be required from the new Contract, is yet to be determined. This will be fully clarified within the Contract Notice when this is issued. This Contract will play a key role in ensuring that Fife\u2019s Advocacy Strategy (2023 \u2013 2026) is successfully implemented. This Contract is a critical requirement. It will assist in ensuring that NHS Fife, Fife Council and the HSCP meet their statutory obligations and will also provide advocacy for a wider group of vulnerable people. The service will be required to establish appropriate methods of supervision, recording and monitoring to ensure each referral is dealt with in a professional and appropriate way, and that the required outcomes are achieved. The advocacy services can be provided by either paid staff, or volunteers, or both. All staff, whether paid or voluntary, must have the appropriate skills, experience, qualification, training and support necessary to meet the specific advocacy needs of the individual service users. There is a requirement for the service provider to work in partnership with other advocacy and voluntary sector providers within Fife, including making and receiving referrals, and promoting advocacy services within Fife.
