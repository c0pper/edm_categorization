Work also includes rehabilitating the viewing platform, replacing all directional and informational signage, and rehabilitating the visitor viewing area around the falls. New retaining walls will be installed to prevent erosion, and areas degraded by high visitor traffic will be restored and native vegetation replanted. Existing visitor viewing areas will be rehabilitated and new viewing locations will be evaluated and added as required.This project includes new and rehabilitated parking areas along the Fighting Creek Gap Road between the Elkmont Campground Entrance Road and Maloney Point. Work includes removing the existing surface, rehabilitating existing parking areas, and constructing new parking areas.

(The following provisions supersede any waiver of First Article Approval Requirements terms set forth in clause 52.209-3 or 52.209-4 as appropriate) (A) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the Naval Inventory Control Point reserves the right to waive the First Article Approval Requirements specified herein for offerors who have previously furnished identical production articles accepted by the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer/Prime Manufacturer. An offeror requesting waiver of First Article Requirements shall submit evidence with its offer establishing that: (I) the last production unit was delivered within three (3) years of the issue date of this solicitation, and (II) the production location to be used for this requirement is the same as used for the previous production run Additionally, the offeror shall submit a certification, to be executed by the officer or employee for the offer, stating that: (I) the articles to be provided will be produced using the same facilities, processes, sequences of operations and approved subcontractors as those previously delivered and accepted by the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer/Prime Manufacturer, and (II) the previous production units were manufactured without Material Review Board disposition or waiver/deviation request or rejection of pre-production samples for cause. (NOTE: This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may render the maker subject to prosecution under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.) (B) Offerors requesting waiver of First Article Approval Requirements under the provisions of this clause are cautioned to submit two prices for articles required herein - one that is based on compliance with the First Article Approval Requirements and one that is based on a waiver of such requirements. Where an offeror submits only one price and fails to clearly state that the price is based on waiver of the First Article Approval Requirements it will be deemed to be based on compliance with the First Article Approval Requirements (C) In the event of the First Article Approval Requirement is granted, the delivery schedule for the production items shall be reduced by the number of days designated for delivery of First Article Test unit plus the number of calendar days indicated for the government notification of conditional approval or approval. These requirements are specified in the quality assurance section of this solicitation. If the offeror is unable to meet the desired schedule, he shall insert below the alternate delivery schedule he offers to the government. Offeror's Proposed Alternate Delivery Schedule (Based on Waiver of First Article Approval Requirements) Within Days: Item No. _______________ Quantity:_______ After Date of Contract:__________ ALL COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO THE FIRST ARTICLE TEST SUBMISSION CONTAINER SHIPMENT TO AND FROM THE FIRST ARTICLE TEST FACILITY ARE TO BE BORNE BY THE CONTRACTOR. Instrumented drop tests are not required for these containers. The design has been proven over years of use and the FAT should test the integrity of the first article rather than the design capability. 4.9 100% PRODUCTION LEAK TEST. Each container shall be prepared for testing by sealing all breathing devices and inserting suitable pressurized fittings and gauges. The container shall be closed and sealed in a normal manner. Each container, uninstrumented and without dummy load, shall then be subjected to a single 18 inch flat drop. The Pneumatic-Pressure Technique of Method 5008 of Federal Test Method Standard No. 101C shall be used to detect leakage. An initial setting equal to 0.5 + 0.1 - 0 PSIG shall be used. After stabilization, pressure shall be monitored for thirty minutes. Any loss in pressure over a 30 minute period that exceeds 25% of the stabilized pressure shall be cause for rejection; tests shall be conducted to ascertain sources of leaks and corrective action taken. Any deformation of the container shell while pressurized which is greater than three-quarters of an inch beyond its point at ambient pressure shall also be cause for rejection. WARNING Container may explode or fasteners may fail during test. Use protective barriers to avoid injury to personnel. 5.
