        "a": "When setting up the weld current sensor for the Bosch PSI 6XXX welding timer, the following cautions regarding cable length must be observed:    Cable Length: The maximum cable length between the KSR sensor and the PSI 6XXX.350 L1 unit should not exceed 100 meters.    Cable Type: Use a shielded cable with a cross-section of 0.75 mm².    Shielding: The connection between the KSR sensor and the PSI 6XXX.350 L1 should be made with a shielded cable. The shield must be connected to X3/3 of the PSI 6XXX.350 L1, but at the sensor end, the shield should remain unconnected.    Placement of Conductors: The current-carrying conductors must be run through the KSR sensor as straight and as centrally oriented as possible. The sensor should be mounted away from current-carrying bus bars and high current-carrying conductors to prevent noise effects from external fields.    Mounting Material: Avoid using metal parts that can be magnetized for mounting the KSR sensor. Copper and brass are preferred materials.    Calibration Measurements: Calibration measurements (scalings) should be made using a suitable welding current meter to assess any potential measuring faults.    Mechanical Stress: In applications with robots or similar devices, certain cable segments might be subjected to severe mechanical stress, which should be considered when selecting cables and designing the cable connection."
