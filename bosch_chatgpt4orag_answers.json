        "q": "What cautions must be observed when setting up weld current sensor regarding cable length?",
        "a": "When setting up the weld current sensor for the Bosch PSI 6XXX welding timer, the following cautions regarding cable length must be observed:    Cable Length: The maximum cable length between the KSR sensor and the PSI 6XXX.350 L1 unit should not exceed 100 meters.    Cable Type: Use a shielded cable with a cross-section of 0.75 mm².    Shielding: The connection between the KSR sensor and the PSI 6XXX.350 L1 should be made with a shielded cable. The shield must be connected to X3/3 of the PSI 6XXX.350 L1, but at the sensor end, the shield should remain unconnected.    Placement of Conductors: The current-carrying conductors must be run through the KSR sensor as straight and as centrally oriented as possible. The sensor should be mounted away from current-carrying bus bars and high current-carrying conductors to prevent noise effects from external fields.    Mounting Material: Avoid using metal parts that can be magnetized for mounting the KSR sensor. Copper and brass are preferred materials.    Calibration Measurements: Calibration measurements (scalings) should be made using a suitable welding current meter to assess any potential measuring faults.    Mechanical Stress: In applications with robots or similar devices, certain cable segments might be subjected to severe mechanical stress, which should be considered when selecting cables and designing the cable connection."

        "q": "What happens when the internal power supply is interrupted?",
        "a": "When the internal power supply is interrupted in the PSI 6XXX welding system, the following events occur:    Interruption of 24 V DC Supply: The 24 V DC supply, which powers the internal logic, inputs, outputs, and load cell, will be interrupted. This affects the operation of the welding timer.    Loss of Communication: Communication via I/O interfaces and between the timer and the programming terminal will cease. This means that programming and visualization tasks cannot be performed.    Stop Function: The stop function is maintained by a floating contact connected to terminals X4/3 and X4/4, ensuring safety even when the internal power is off.These impacts are crucial to consider for the reliable operation and safety of the welding system."
