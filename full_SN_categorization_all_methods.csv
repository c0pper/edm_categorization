 ### DESCRIPTION:
 This Invitation to Tender (ITT) is issued by WSCC to seek and identify suitably qualified and interested organisations from the private, public and third (voluntary, community and charitable) sector to carry out surveys and to prepare a design and costing of the installation and maintenance of Solar PV and BESS, to install the equipment and to maintain the equipment at Designated Sites identified in Document No. 9 (Asset List). There is also the opportunity to add Pipeline Sites and Wider Estate to the Programme as detailed under 5- Scope of the ITT.<br/><br/> <br/>The Solar PV and Battery Storage Programme (“SPVBS Programme”) is set up in three phases: Phase 1 NEC4 Term Services Contract (“NEC4 TSC for Phase 1”) for the survey, design and costing works, Phase 2 NEC4 Engineering and Construction Contract (“NEC4 ECC for Phase 2”) for the installation works and Phase 3 NEC4 Term Services Contract (“NEC4 TSC for Phase 3”) for the ongoing maintenance services.  <br/><br/> <br/>Following approval of the design and costing carried out in Phase 1 in relation to each Designated Site and/or Pipeline Site and/or Wider Estate, WSCC may then proceed to appoint the Contractor to carry out the installation of the equipment at that Site under Phase 2 and maintenance of the Equipment at that Site under Phase 3, in accordance with the relevant Contract Terms and Conditions as set out in Document 03 (Contract Terms and Conditions).  <br/><br/> <br/>WSCC is under no obligation to award a contract under Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 in respect of any Designated Site and/or Pipeline Site and/or Wider Estate that is subsequently incorporated into the Programme.  <br/><br/> <br/>The Works, as further described in Document No. 2 (The Specification) are being tendered by WSCC in accordance with WSCC’s Standing Orders on Procurement and Contracts and the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). <br/><br/>This is the only programme in place for delivering retrofit roof-top solar PV and ‘Behind the Meter’ Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) across WSCC’s estate. The contract value (of up to £23m) therefore allows all remaining corporate sites and schools in the Wider Estate, in West Sussex, to be approached to register their interest in being surveyed and if found suitable to be brought into the SPVBS Programme over the Contract Period.  <br/><br/>  <br/>Following a market engagement exercise and technical and structural feasibility surveys completed by WSCC’s multi-disciplinary contractor (MDC), AtkinsRealis (AR), 23 corporate and 56 school sites including Pipeline Sites (see Document No. 09 Asset List) have been identified to date as suitable for having Solar PV and, where suitable, BESS technology installations.  <br/><br/>  <br/>All 56 schools registered their interest in having Solar PV, and where suitable, BESS installed.

These are referred to as the “Designated Sites”.  <br/><br/> <br/>WSCC is currently working with the Department for Education (DfE) to gain formal commitment from the 14 academy schools (which form part of the 56 schools) to sign up to the Programme. The academy schools and the 4 other non-WSCC owned schools, require a lease agreement to be signed (“the Lease”) and the terms of the Lease agreements shall be agreed with the DfE and academy trusts. Once the approved draft Lease agreement has been shared with the academies, and other non-WSCC owned sites, these schools will also be asked to commit to participating in the Programme via an LOI.

Ordering information is included as an attachment to this contract/purchase order. DOCUMENT REF DATA=MIL-STD-129                   |    |  |P  |041029|A|  |03| 3.  REQUIREMENTS 3.1   Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The RECTIFIER ASSY  repaired under this contract/purchase order shall meet the operational and functional requirements as represented by the Cage Code(s) and reference number(s) listed below. All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;24930        195809-2; 3.2   Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3   Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order.  When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor.  If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation.  When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1:  PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2:  Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3:  Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4:  Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5:  Part redesigned - New part replaces old.  Old part cannot replace new. Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2   Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings. 4.3   Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1   Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The INDICATOR,AZIMUTH  repaired under this contract/purchase order shall meet the operational and functional requirements as represented by the Cage Code(s) and reference number(s) listed below. All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;24930       G300082S1              ; 3.2   Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3   Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order.  When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor.  If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation.  When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1:  PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2:  Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3:  Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4:  Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5:  Part redesigned - New part replaces old.  Old part cannot replace new. Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

NOTES 6.1   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no. Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)           which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase           order. Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined           in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B           of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals           without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,           conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and           acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the           codes is as follows:               DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                     SS               (1)           (2)                     DD               (3)           (4)                     SD               (1)           (4)                     DS               (3)           (5)                     LT               (6)           (7)                     NO               (8)           (8)                     XX               (9)           (9)           (1)  Inspection at source.

LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.                Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising                Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.           (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition           of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:           A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.           B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.           C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with               a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the               DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,               Mich. or Government activities.           D.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities               and DOD contractors only.           E.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components               only.           F.  Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign               Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10:  Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to            be delivered to the Government.  The abbreviations and            their meaning.               ANNLY                  Annually               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               BI-MO                  Every two months               BI-WE                  Every two weeks               DAILY                  Daily               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               MTHLY                  Monthly               ONE/R                  One time with revisions               QRTLY                  Quarterly               SEMIA                  Every six months               WEKLY                  Weekly               XTIME                  Number of times to be submitted                                      (1time, 2times...9times)            Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16           to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately           price the deliverable data item.           Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on           occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other           abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16           of the DD Form 1423. Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day            format, the deliverable item is to be received by the            requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423            for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single            delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple            times, the number stated is the number of calendar days            after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be            received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the            DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be            required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency            cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be            fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to            the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in            year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their            meaning are as follows:               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               DAC                    Days after contract date               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               EOC                    End of contract               EOM                    End of month               EOQ                    End of quarter        Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in        Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific        event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16        of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred        Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after            the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to            indicate the specific time period. The data is required when            Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is            required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable            item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined            to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to             be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full             name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific             information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to             be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted             Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.             (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required            by Block 14. Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information            Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to            tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the            minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are            allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for            delivery of the data. Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.2  In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings.   There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.  The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea      Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3 1.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1   Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The PSCU COMPUT TABLET furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s).  Cage _______ ref. no.                      ;96169       EB-5901-V1; 3.2   Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-130, REV N, 16 NOV 2012; . 3.3   Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order.  When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor.  If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation.  When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1:  PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2:  Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3:  Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4:  Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5:  Part redesigned - New part replaces old.  Old part cannot replace new. Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.3   Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 5.

Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2   Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government.  The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1    ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize MIL-I-45208 if desired.; 4.3   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals           without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found.

LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.                Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising                Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.           (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition           of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:           A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.           B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.           C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with               a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the               DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,               Mich. or Government activities.

ANNLY                  Annually               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               BI-MO                  Every two months               BI-WE                  Every two weeks               DAILY                  Daily               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               MTHLY                  Monthly               ONE/R                  One time with revisions               QRTLY                  Quarterly               SEMIA                  Every six months               WEKLY                  Weekly               XTIME                  Number of times to be submitted                                      (1time, 2times...9times)            Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16           to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately           price the deliverable data item.           Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on           occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other           abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16           of the DD Form 1423. Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day            format, the deliverable item is to be received by the            requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423            for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single            delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple            times, the number stated is the number of calendar days            after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be            received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the            DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be            required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency            cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be            fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to            the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in            year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their            meaning are as follows:               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               DAC                    Days after contract date               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               EOC                    End of contract               EOM                    End of month               EOQ                    End of quarter        Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in        Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific        event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16        of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred        Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after            the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to            indicate the specific time period. The data is required when            Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is            required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable            item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined            to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to             be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full             name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific             information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to             be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted             Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.             (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required            by Block 14. Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information            Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to            tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the            minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are            allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for            delivery of the data. Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable.

Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.) 3.6   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.3   Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 4.4    ;Inspection System - The Supplier's Quality Inspection System shall be in accordance with MIL-I-45208 or ISO 9001 and NCSL Z540.3 or ISO 10012.

F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea      Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no. Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)           which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase           order.

Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes.

LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.

(9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition           of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:           A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.           B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.           C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with               a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the               DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,               Mich. or Government activities.

Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on           occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other           abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16           of the DD Form 1423. Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day            format, the deliverable item is to be received by the            requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423            for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single            delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple            times, the number stated is the number of calendar days            after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be            received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the            DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be            required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency            cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be            fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to            the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in            year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their            meaning are as follows:               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               DAC                    Days after contract date               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               EOC                    End of contract               EOM                    End of month               EOQ                    End of quarter        Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in        Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific        event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16        of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred        Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after            the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to            indicate the specific time period. The data is required when            Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is            required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable            item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined            to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to             be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full             name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific             information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to             be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted             Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.             (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required            by Block 14. Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information            Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to            tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the            minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are            allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for            delivery of the data. Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. THE PACKAGING LABEL SHALL BE MARKED WITH THE NOMENCLATURE AS CITED ON IRPOD.

NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals           without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,           conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and           acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the           codes is as follows:               DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                     SS               (1)           (2)                     DD               (3)           (4)                     SD               (1)           (4)                     DS               (3)           (5)                     LT               (6)           (7)                     NO               (8)           (8)                     XX               (9)           (9)           (1)  Inspection at source.

LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.                Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising                Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.           (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.

Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on           occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other           abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16           of the DD Form 1423. Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day            format, the deliverable item is to be received by the            requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423            for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single            delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple            times, the number stated is the number of calendar days            after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be            received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the            DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be            required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency            cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be            fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to            the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in            year/month/day format.

If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific        event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16        of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred        Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after            the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to            indicate the specific time period. The data is required when            Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is            required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable            item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined            to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to             be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full             name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific             information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to             be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted             Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.             (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required            by Block 14.

This block is also the only area used to            tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the            minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are            allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for            delivery of the data. Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. DATE OF FIRST SUBMISSION=EOC Submit at the time of material delivery a Certificate of Compliance per DI-MISC-81356 to NAVSUP-WSS code N9433. A separate Certificate of Compliance shall be prepared and submitted for each unique combination of Contract/Purchase Order Number, National Stock Number and Item Nomenclature specified in the schedule of Supply/Services.

NOTES 6.1   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no. Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)           which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase           order. Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined           in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B           of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals           without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,           conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and           acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the           codes is as follows:               DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                     SS               (1)           (2)                     DD               (3)           (4)                     SD               (1)           (4)                     DS               (3)           (5)                     LT               (6)           (7)                     NO               (8)           (8)                     XX               (9)           (9)           (1)  Inspection at source.           (2)  Acceptance at source.           (3)  No inspection performed at source.  Final inspection                performance at destination.           (4)  Acceptance at destination.           (5)  Acceptance at source.  Acceptance based on written                approval from the Contract Officer.           (6)  Letter of transmittal only.  LT should not be used when                inspection is required.  The data is sent by the                contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14                of the DD Form 1423.  LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.                Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising                Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.           (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition           of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:           A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.           B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.           C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with               a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the               DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,               Mich. or Government activities.           D.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities               and DOD contractors only.           E.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components               only.           F.  Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign               Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10:  Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to            be delivered to the Government.  The abbreviations and            their meaning.               ANNLY                  Annually               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               BI-MO                  Every two months               BI-WE                  Every two weeks               DAILY                  Daily               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               MTHLY                  Monthly               ONE/R                  One time with revisions               QRTLY                  Quarterly               SEMIA                  Every six months               WEKLY                  Weekly               XTIME                  Number of times to be submitted                                      (1time, 2times...9times)            Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16           to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately           price the deliverable data item.           Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on           occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other           abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16           of the DD Form 1423. Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day            format, the deliverable item is to be received by the            requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423            for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single            delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple            times, the number stated is the number of calendar days            after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be            received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the            DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be            required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency            cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be            fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to            the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in            year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their            meaning are as follows:               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               DAC                    Days after contract date               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               EOC                    End of contract               EOM                    End of month               EOQ                    End of quarter        Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in        Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific        event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16        of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred        Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after            the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to            indicate the specific time period. The data is required when            Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is            required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable            item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined            to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to             be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full             name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific             information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to             be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted             Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.             (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required            by Block 14. Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information            Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to            tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the            minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are            allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for            delivery of the data. Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.2  In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings.   There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.  The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only.

 CF - Attendance Mentors Pilot Expansion

 ### DESCRIPTION:
 Regular attendance at school is vital for children's education, wellbeing, and long-term development. Improving attendance is a priority. Support for pupils who are persistently absent was also the subject of a recent education select committee enquiry: Persistent absence and support for disadvantaged pupils - Committees - UK Parliament. The Department is currently piloting a 3-year intensive mentoring programme in 5 priority education investment areas (PEIAs), delivering attendance mentoring support for pupils in areas with high levels of persistent absence. We are now looking into options to expand this pilot programme into more PEIAs. The Department for Education is seeking to appoint a Supplier to deliver targeted, responsive, one-to-one support for at least 10,800 persistently and severely absent pupils across 10 Priority Education Investment Areas (PEIA).  The successful Supplier would be expected to train mentors to be able to support pupils and families on a one-to-one basis with the intention of understanding barriers to the pupils attendance and supporting the pupil and family to resolve this. This support should be responsive to the individuals needs and may be delivered in the school, or in the pupil's home. Depending on the pupil need, trained practitioners may also be expected to work with external local agencies to ensure all support to a particular family or pupil is aligned and drives towards overcoming attendance barriers. Mentor work could also involve working closely with families to support better engagement in education. The successful Supplier will also need to work with evaluators to evidence the impact of the support throughout the project lifecycle.  The initial contract period is for 29 months for delivery over 2 academic years plus the set up period, assuming that the contract will be signed in June 2024, to allow for implementation and mobilisation activities ahead of delivery commencing in October 2024 and conclude in October 2026. This initial contract period may vary slightly in duration if contract signature is delayed for any reason. There will be an option to extend for a further 12 months at the Department's sole discretion.  Continuation of the contract into academic years 2 and 3 will be subject to satisfactory performance. The maximum contract length would be 3 academic years of delivery plus the set up period. Additional information:  To register your interest to tender and view the tender documents, you will need to be registered as a supplier on the DfE Jaggaer eTendering portal, available at https://education.app.jaggaer.com/web/login.html   Once registered the information will be accessible via the 'View Opportunities' link on the Homepage.

There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.  The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea      Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no. Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)           which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase           order. Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined           in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B           of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals           without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,           conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and           acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the           codes is as follows:               DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                     SS               (1)           (2)                     DD               (3)           (4)                     SD               (1)           (4)                     DS               (3)           (5)                     LT               (6)           (7)                     NO               (8)           (8)                     XX               (9)           (9)           (1)  Inspection at source.

LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.                Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising                Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.           (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition           of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:           A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.           B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.           C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with               a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the               DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,               Mich. or Government activities.           D.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities               and DOD contractors only.           E.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components               only.           F.

Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable.

The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.         Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.         The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.         Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 3.4.1   NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG. 3.4.2    ;Per the NAVSEA molding manual (S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG REV 2),in process step number 4-9 (PRESHIPMENT INSPECTION),the manual states: ""ensure test inspection report (DS9: appendix II-F),is properly completed and is packaged with cable assembly"".  ; 3.5   Source Control Item - Previous delivery of the specified National Stock Number or similar item manufactured to technical procurement specifications and/or drawings supplied by a Government activity or Price Contractor does not in itself qualify a supplier as a Government approved source.
