    "offer": "### TITLE:\n Carbon Pollution Free Electricity \u2013 EACs in the form of RECs - Basic Ordering Agreement RFP\n\n ### DESCRIPTION:\n LA ENERGY, Electricity Team (csteam@dla.mil) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) under NSN 9140-01-456-2020 with qualified offerors, on an OPEN CONTINUOUS basis to provide Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) in the form of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to various Continental United States (CONUS) Department of Defense and Federal Civilian installations. In support of Carbon Pollution-Free Electricity initiatives and in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 14057, the EAC in the form of RECs BOA RFP will be open continuously for a period of five (5) years from solicitation issue date identified on the SF1449 Block 6. The purpose of a BOA is to establish multiple agreements, based on initial non-price factor evaluations (which will be identified in Section M of the subsequent Request for Proposal). A BOA is not a contract; it is an agreement. A BOA does not imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with contractors. $20M is the maximum ordering capacity for all potential orders issued amongst all BOA Holder(s) over the 5-year ordering period cumulatively. DLA Energy is the Administrator (owner) of the BOA(s) and is the only Ordering Agency authorized to modify the base terms and clause of BOA Holders. Authorized Ordering Agencies may add local provisions or clauses when they issue RFQ\u2019s referencing the BOA, provided they do not conflict with the BOA terms and clauses. The Government is maximizing BOA participation by going out \u201cfull and open.\u201d For anticipated requirements expected under this BOA, DLA Energy determined the most predominant North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code to be 221115- \u2018Wind Electric Power Generation'. The Federal Register was used to provide rationale for the Request for Proposals (RFP) NAICS determination. In accordance with Part V Small Business Administration 78 Fed. Reg. 191 (Oct 2, 2013), the predominant\u00a0(NAICS) code and size standard is required for all contracts, as well as for all orders. NAICS 221115 shares the same Size Standard as all other supplies that will be identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) Section B, \"Supplies to be Furnished\".
