    "offer": "### TITLE:\n Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS)\n\n ### DESCRIPTION:\n OFFICIAL RELEASE:\u00a0Attached is the\u00a0Request For Proposal (RFP) and all attachments for the manufacturing and production of Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS), (NSN 170-01-513-9539RN). The Support Equipment and Vehicles Division at Robins AFB, GA (AFLCMC/WNZ) has a requirement for an 8-year, firm-fixed price (FFP)/fixed price with economic price adjustment (FPEPA), requirements-type contract for the Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). It has been determined that this requirement involves items that have a Critical Safety item and/or Critical Item Application and therefore requires sources be pre-qualified in order to propose. To be considered a qualified source, vendors shall have an active Source Approval Request (SAR). To obtain a Source Approval Request, please notify the POC's listed in the Contact Information section of this notice.\u00a0 All responsible/qualified sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.\u00a0 The MAAS is a military unique deployable asset developed as an expeditionary aircraft recovery system, which can be quickly setup and used to recover tactical aircraft at damaged runways or at installations where primary arresting systems are not in operation. The MAAS consists of two identical mobile units. Each unit houses one Barrier Arresting Kit (BAK)-12 rotary friction energy absorber. The mobile units (i.e. trailers) contain all the basic components of a fixed base arresting system and all the tools and hardware necessary for installation and removal. These units are capable of being transported over land, sea and through the air. This acquisition will be a competitive, total small business set-aside utilizing trade-off source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 and 15.3 as supplemented by the DoD Source Selection Procedures (Aug 2022) referenced in DFARS 215.300 and the DAFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3 to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision. Tradeoffs may be made between past performance and cost/price, with past performance being considered significantly more important than cost/price. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the superior past and present performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost/price difference. To arrive at a best value decision, the SSA will integrate the Source Selection Team's (SST's) evaluations of the factors described in this provision. Foreign participation will not be limited for this solicitation and subsequent awards. Interested offerors may contact, via email, the POCs listed below for any additional questions. NO TELEPHONE QUESTIONS will be accepted. Offerors are encouraged to register on the site to receive notifications regarding the solicitation and all amendments/revisions. **Due to size, the MAAS Technical Drawing Package (TDP) was not loaded onto SAM.gov. The Drawing Package will be released separately via DoD SAFE upon offcial request sent via email to kimberly.mercer.1@us.af.mil and dylan.huckeba@us.af.mil",
