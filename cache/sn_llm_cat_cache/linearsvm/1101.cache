The successful agency will be asked to create and deliver a major, high-profile campaign including research and insight; production of digital and physical materials; and measurement and evaluation, for an overall approximate cost of \u00a3150,000 to be rolled out across Greater Manchester starting early in Spring 2024 and running over a period of up to 18 months.
