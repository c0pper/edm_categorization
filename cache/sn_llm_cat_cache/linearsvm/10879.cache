    "text": "BT 1693 - Sustainability and Net Zero Business Support Luton Borough Council require a programme of business support that will help SMEs in reducing their carbon footprint and support the Council's aim to be carbon neutral by 2040, as stated in our 204 vision. Additionally it will promote the opportunities that open up due to introducing sustainability and good practice measures and introduce the skills to capitalise on them. The vast majority of Luton's businesses are SMEs, many of which have not started, or at a very early stage in their Net Zero journey. Tackling the climate emergency and becoming a net zero town with sustainable growth and a healthier environment is one of the 5 priorities within the Council's Luton 2040 vision. ",
