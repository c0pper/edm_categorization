There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.  The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea      Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no. Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)           which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase           order. Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined           in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B           of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals           without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,           conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and           acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the           codes is as follows:               DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                     SS               (1)           (2)                     DD               (3)           (4)                     SD               (1)           (4)                     DS               (3)           (5)                     LT               (6)           (7)                     NO               (8)           (8)                     XX               (9)           (9)           (1)  Inspection at source.           (2)  Acceptance at source.           (3)  No inspection performed at source.  Final inspection                performance at destination.           (4)  Acceptance at destination.

LT should not be used when                inspection is required.  The data is sent by the                contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14                of the DD Form 1423.  LT is used when the contracting                agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each                and every piece of data developed by the contractor.                The only other authorized use of LT is the special                case where the contracting agency does not desire to                have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a                Government quality assurance representative perform                inspection.  The Government quality assurance                representative shall be listed on the distribution                in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via                the quality assurance letter of inspection.                Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising                final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical                Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of                preliminary TDP's or TM's).           (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.           (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or                letter of transmittal required.                Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising                Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.           (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere                in the contract. Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring           specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of           the final data item will be identified by placing an \"A\"           in this field.  This data item requires submission of a           preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.           When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD           Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government           approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the           contractor to resubmit the data after Government           approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also           indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,           approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the           Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition           of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:           A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.           B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.           C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with               a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the               DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,               Mich. or Government activities.           D.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities               and DOD contractors only.           E.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components               only.           F.  Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign               Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10:  Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to            be delivered to the Government.  The abbreviations and            their meaning.               ANNLY                  Annually               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               BI-MO                  Every two months               BI-WE                  Every two weeks               DAILY                  Daily               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               MTHLY                  Monthly               ONE/R                  One time with revisions               QRTLY                  Quarterly               SEMIA                  Every six months               WEKLY                  Weekly               XTIME                  Number of times to be submitted                                      (1time, 2times...9times)            Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16           to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately           price the deliverable data item.           Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on           occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other           abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16           of the DD Form 1423. Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day            format, the deliverable item is to be received by the            requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423            for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single            delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple            times, the number stated is the number of calendar days            after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be            received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the            DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be            required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency            cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be            fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to            the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in            year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their            meaning are as follows:               ASGEN                  As generated               ASREQ                  As required               DAC                    Days after contract date               DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery               EOC                    End of contract               EOM                    End of month               EOQ                    End of quarter        Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in        Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific        event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16        of the DD Form 1423.  \"As generated\", \"As required\", and \"Deferred        Delivery\" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after            the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to            indicate the specific time period. The data is required when            Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is            required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable            item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined            to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to             be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full             name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific             information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to             be submitted.  When final \"Repro\" copies are to be submitted             Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.             (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required            by Block 14. Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information            Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to            tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the            minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are            allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for            delivery of the data. Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the            appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:            A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this                type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price                would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General                and Administrative (G&A) and profit.            B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be                reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.                The price for data in this group would be based on the direct                cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and                to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.            C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own                use and which requires no substantial change to conform to                Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,                frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only                the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,                G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.            D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part                of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required                and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally                be coded \"no charge.\"  An example is a brochure or brief manual                developed for commercial application which will be acquired                in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify                the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go                with the acquisition. Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total            price which is estimated to be attributable to the production            or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE            ENTRY \"N/C\" FOR \"NO CHARGE\" is acceptable.
