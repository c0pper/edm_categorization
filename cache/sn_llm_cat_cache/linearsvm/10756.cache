    "text": "Scope 3 Carbon Emissions Annual Reporting DWP recently completed a Net Zero Carbon Strategic Review, which identified that 78% of DWP's emissions are Scope 3 (emissions that are not directly produced directly by an organisation but that they are indirectly responsible for, up and down the value chain), the majority of which are not currently being captured as part of the Department's GGC or ARA reporting.   These findings were presented to ET, where it was agreed that the Department should continue to measure, reduce, and report Scope 3 emissions.",
