Participation or non-participation in the PPME shall not prevent any supplier participating in a potential future procurement, nor is it intended that any information supplied as part of the PPME shall place any supplier at an advantage in a potential procurement process. Participation in the PPME will be at each organisation\u2019s own cost. No expense in responding to this PPME will be reimbursed by the Council.Further information can be found within the attached documentation. You are invited to submit a completed questionnaire by 12 noon on 11th March 2024. Please log in or register at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/supplyhertfordshire/aspx/Home",
