    "text": "GB-London: Engaging the experience and expertise of those with care experience We require a short guide to support councils and other organisations who wish to work with those with care experience for the purposes of co-production, consultation, training or other forms of engagement in which a person's lived experience of children's social care is a key part of the expertise they bring. This follows feedback from some in the care experienced community who highlight poor practice in this area, including lack of payment and an expectation that traumatic experiences will be recounted. Additional information: The contracting authority considers that this contract may be suitable for economic operators that are small or medium enterprises (SMEs). However, any selection of tenderers will be based solely on the criteria set out for the procurement.",
