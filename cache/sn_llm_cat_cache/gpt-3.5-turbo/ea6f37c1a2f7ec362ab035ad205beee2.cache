The trailhead is seven miles southwest of Gatlinburg along Fighting Creek Gap Road. Access to the trailhead is via Fighting Creek Gap Road. From the trailhead to Laurel Falls, the transportation of construction equipment and building materials will take extra coordination and is limited to equipment that can navigate the existing approximately 5\u00bf wide asphalt trail. Site access issues will be identified in Division 1 specs.The project will have limited staging located near the trailhead and along Laurel Falls Trail. The trail will be closed for the duration of construction activities. The Park and Fighting Creek Gap Road will remain open during construction, thus contract activities and logistics must be structured and scheduled to minimize visitor and operations impact. The new improvements will be constructed in an area considered a natural resource and protective measures are required to ensure the surrounding natural areas remain undisturbed and all construction activities remain within project site boundaries identified in the Construction Documents.This project will rehabilitate the Laurel Falls trail. Work includes demolition and removing the existing surface, rehabilitating the trail foundation, and widening the trail where required. Retaining walls will be rehabilitated and culverts replaced. Work also includes rehabilitating the viewing platform, replacing all directional and informational signage, and rehabilitating the visitor viewing area around the falls. New retaining walls will be installed to prevent erosion, and areas degraded by high visitor traffic will be restored and native vegetation replanted. Existing visitor viewing areas will be rehabilitated and new viewing locations will be evaluated and added as required.This project includes new and rehabilitated parking areas along the Fighting Creek Gap Road between the Elkmont Campground Entrance Road and Maloney Point. Work includes removing the existing surface, rehabilitating existing parking areas, and constructing new parking areas. New retaining walls will be installed to allow for the new parking areas.Challenges: one-way in/out 1.3 miles; max trail width 8\u00bf (no large vehicles); steep mountain terrain; limited staging areas.Estimated Period of Performance: The total anticipated period of performance is 540 days after Notice to Proceed.NO RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED AND NO QUESTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME.Vendors should continue to monitor the SAM.gov website for further information about this project under notice 140P2023R0044 and/or PMIS# GRSM 213075 Rehabilitate Laurel Falls Trail",
