The resultant award of this solicitation will be issued bilaterally, requirig the contractor's written acceptance prior to execution. 2. Any contract/orer awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a \"DO\" rated order certifie for national defense use under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (PAS). See 52.211-14, Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense, Emergency reparedness, and Energy Program Use. 3. If drawings are included in the soliciation, access must be requested on the individual solicitation page on ContractOpportunities via the Government's SAM.gov website. Include your CAGE code in yur request. 4. Unless otherwise stated on the DD1423, submission of DD1423 cerification data (CDRLs) will be on or before 20 days prior to the material delivry date. PNSY review/acceptance of CDRLs shall be 6 working days after receipt f CDRLs. Final delivery of material will  be on or before 365 days after the effctive date of the contract. \\ 1.  SCOPE 1.1   The material covered in this contract/purchase order will be used in a crucial shipboard system.  The use of incorrect or defective material would create a high probability of failure resulting in serious personnel injury, loss of life, loss of vital shipboard systems, or loss of the ship itself.  Therefore, the material has been designated as SPECIAL EMPHASIS material (Level I, Scope of Certification, or Quality Assured) and special control procedures are invoked to ensure receipt of correct material. 2.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 2.1  Order of Precedence - In the event of a conflict between the text of this contract/purchase order and the references and/or drawings cited herein, the text of this contract/purchase order must take precedence.  Nothing in this contract/purchase order, however, must supersede applicable  laws and regulations unless a specific exemption has been obtained. 2.2   Applicable Documents - The document(s) listed below form a part of this contract/purchase order including modifications or exclusions. 2.2.1  Specification Revisions - The specification revisions listed under \"Documents References\" below are the preferred revision. Older and/or newer r evisions are acceptable when listed within Contract Support Library Reference Number CSD155 in ECDS (Electric Contractor Data Submission) at: ht tps://register.nslc.navy.mil/. This is to allow Contractors to use certain acceptable older specification revisions to purge their existing stock of material certified to those older revisions or to use newer specification revisions when material is certified to newly released revisions,without requiring the submittal of waiver/deviation requests for each specification revision on every contract. Revisions of specifications reflecting editorial and/or re-approval (e.g. E2009, R2014, etc.) are considered inconsequential, but are acceptable when their revisions are listedwithin CSD155 or elsewhere within this contract. 2.2.2   Documents, drawings, and publications supplied are listed under \"Drawing Number\".  These items should be retained until an award is made. 2.2.3   \"Document References\" listed below must be obtained by the Contractor.   Ordering information is included as an attachment to this contract/purchase order.

Substitution of thecommercial equivalent inspection in accordance with ASME B1 series is acceptable. 3.6.1  System 21 of FED-STD-H28/20 must be used as a minimum inspection requirement for threads when the design drawing or design specification does not specify an inspection requirement. 3.6.2  For Navy and Shipyard drawings, system 21 of FED-STD-H28/20 may be substituted for System 22 without further Navy approval when the design drawing invokes System 22 and does not cite governing specifications that specifically require system 22. System 22 of FED-STD-H28/20 must be used when the drawing references other governing specifications that specifically require System 22, such as certain thread types of MIL-DTL-1222. 3.6.3  A written request for concurrence must be submitted when utilizing alternative measuring equipment or measuring systems not applicable to the specified inspection system. 3.7  O-ring grooves and mating sealing surfaces must be inspected per the contractually invoked drawings or specifications.  When the drawings or specifications do not provide specific defect criteria or state that no defects are allowed, the General Acceptance Criteria (GAC) standard must be used for inspecting O-ring grooves and mating sealing surfaces only.  Repairs to sealing surfaces and O-ring grooves with unacceptable defects may be accomplished within the limits of the size and tolerances provided in the applicable drawing.  Repairs thatwould exceed these limits require approval (including final dimensions).  The data that is red lined (crossed out) is excluded from the GAC for this contract and is not to be used for acceptance or rejection criteria.  The GAC document is identified as Contract Support Library Reference Number CSD008 at https://register.nslc.navy.mil/ 3.8   Certificate of Compliance - (SPECIAL EMPHASIS MATERIAL) The Contractor must prepare and submit a certificate of compliance certifying that the items/components furnished under this contract comply with the requirements of the procurement document, including any/all invoked specifications and drawings. 3.9   Configuration Control - The Contractor must maintain the total equipment baseline configuration.  For items of proprietary design, Contractor drawings showing the latest assembly configuration must be provided to the Government in electronic (C4) format. Definitions are provided elsewhere in the Contract/Purchase Order. 3.9.1   Waivers/Deviations - All waivers and deviations, regardless of significance or classification require review and approval by the Contracting Officer.  Waivers and Deviations must be designated as Critical, Major, or Minor.  The Contractor must provide a copy of this request to the QAR.  Requests must include the information listed below.    a.  A complete description of the contract requirement affected        and the nature of the waiver/deviation (non-conformance),        including a classification of Critical, Major, or Minor.    b.  Number of units (and serial/lot numbers) to be delivered in this        configuration.    c.  Any impacts to logistics support elements (such as software,        manuals, spares, tools, and similar) being utilized by Government        personnel or impacts to the operational use of the product.    d.  Information about remedial action being taken to prevent reoccurrence        of the non-conformance. 3.9.2  All requests for Waivers/Deviations on NAVSUP-WSS Contracts must be submitted to the NAVSUP WSS Contracting Specialist via eMail. 3.9.3  ECPs - The Government will maintain configuration control and change authority for all modifications or changes affecting form, fit, function, or interface parameters of the Equipment and its sub-assemblies.  The Contractor must submit an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) for any Class I or II changes that impact the Equipment covered by this contract.  ECPs must be prepared in Contractor format, and must include the following information:    a.
