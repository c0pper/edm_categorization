    "offer": "### TITLE:\n Provision of an Independent Advocacy Service\n\n ### DESCRIPTION:\n Fife Council, on behalf of Fife Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP), is publishing this Prior Information Notice (PIN) to notify the market of a future tender opportunity to provide an Independent Advocacy Service. Health Boards and local authorities have a statutory responsibility under a range of legislation affecting both children and adults to provide access to independent advocacy for specific groups of people. The commissioned service is aligned to the Partnership\u2019s Advocacy Strategy (2023 \u2013 2026). Fife\u2019s Advocacy Strategy 2023-2026 sets out the commitment to the provision of independent advocacy services in Fife and to improving awareness of access to services to ensure the best outcomes for people who are unable to speak up for themselves. Fife Health and Social Care Partnership recognises the importance of advocacy in: -Empowering people to access information, express their own needs, explore options and make their own, informed decisions. -Ensuring that people\u2019s rights are not infringed and making it easier for people to exercise those rights and have their voice heard when decisions are being made about their care. -Ensuring a safeguard for people who may be at risk of being treated unfairly due to circumstances that make them vulnerable. Priority will be given to those individuals for whom the Partnership has a statutory duty to provide access to an independent advocacy service and for whom Scottish Government policy, guidance and standards gives precedence. Aims of the Service: - -Professional advocacy will be provided to vulnerable people, aged 16 and over, who are affected by disability, chronic illness or mental disorder, and who are unable to safeguard their own well-being, rights, care or other interests. -Those eligible to receive this service specifically, but not exclusively, includes people with mental health issues, learning disabilities, personality disorder, physical disabilities, acquired brain injury, dementia and autistic spectrum disorders, as well as chronic illness. -Professional advocacy will also be provided to children under 16 years who are subject to compulsory measures under the Mental Health (Care & Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, or are the subject of a Welfare Guardianship application, under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. -A collective advocacy service will be provided for specific groups, where there is an identified need. This will be negotiated with the service provider with consideration of available resources. The current Advocacy Contract in place requires provision of professional advocacy for a minimum of 950 issues per year. The minimum number of issues which will be required from the new Contract, is yet to be determined. This will be fully clarified within the Contract Notice when this is issued. This Contract will play a key role in ensuring that Fife\u2019s Advocacy Strategy (2023 \u2013 2026) is successfully implemented. This Contract is a critical requirement. It will assist in ensuring that NHS Fife, Fife Council and the HSCP meet their statutory obligations and will also provide advocacy for a wider group of vulnerable people. The service will be required to establish appropriate methods of supervision, recording and monitoring to ensure each referral is dealt with in a professional and appropriate way, and that the required outcomes are achieved. The advocacy services can be provided by either paid staff, or volunteers, or both. All staff, whether paid or voluntary, must have the appropriate skills, experience, qualification, training and support necessary to meet the specific advocacy needs of the individual service users. There is a requirement for the service provider to work in partnership with other advocacy and voluntary sector providers within Fife, including making and receiving referrals, and promoting advocacy services within Fife.
