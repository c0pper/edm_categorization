For patients on dialysis: a dedicated, personal, face-to-face support service serving the 8,867 kidney patients on dialysis treatment in the 128 renal units across the North East, North West, the South West and South East of England, and Scotland. Delivered by trained and trusted Patient Support Officers (PSOs), the service will enable patients to access all the benefits and welfare support they are entitled to. Patients will also benefit from access to specialist money and energy advice, framed within the context of the specific challenges faced by kidney patients. Over the two years of the project, they would expect to directly reach the total number of patients receiving dialysis in these focus regions - currently 8,867. For patients with advanced CKD: The face-to-face service will be further enhanced by a new 0800/0300 helpline, providing immediate support across a wide range of issues accompanied, which builds on local Hampshire-based team who currently answer inbound enquiries to the charity. Look to expand this provision and make it easier for people living with CKD to get in touch. Using a free-to-call number (0800 or 0300) people will be encouraged to contact them without charge, and without geographical reference. Calls will then be directed to the first available operator who will be able to answer their query with specialist knowledge of the condition and further support that could be available to the caller. This project operates across all the GDN networks and aligns to collective GDN strategic ambition to support vulnerable customers most in need. It will provide support to consumers living with CKD to help tackle fuel poverty, resulting in a positive Social Return on Investment.",
