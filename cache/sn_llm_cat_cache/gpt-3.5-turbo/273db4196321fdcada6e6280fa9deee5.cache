    "offer": "### TITLE:\n Altus Air Force Base Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)\n\n ### DESCRIPTION:\n Altus AFB, Oklahoma is conducting a CSO in accordance with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 212.70. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement (BAA), to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services, based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject-matter expert peers within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain \"innovative\" solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfill requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures, not currently in use by the Air Force, that would enhance or streamline Air Force mission capabilities. \u201cInnovative\u201d is defined as any technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It also includes any new application of an existing technology, process, or method. Based on identified funding allocations, the Air Force is targeting solutions for potentially multiple problems with a cumulative price up to $250,000. However, the Air Force will still evaluate proposed solutions priced individually or cumulatively greater than $250,000 for potential award consideration should funds become available. Funds are not currently available. This CSO contains broadly defined areas of interest and interest in more specific requirements. While these areas of interest are geared towards meeting Altus AFB requirements, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements outside of Altus AFB with similar areas of interest and mission requirements.
