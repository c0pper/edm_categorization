FFT results are submitted monthly to NHS England, contributing to national statistics and benchmarking. Leveraging SMS and IVR, the Trust extensively employs text messages and telephone surveys to gather patient experience feedback through the Friends and Family Test Survey.  Between October 2022 and September 2023, the number of eligible patients to participate in the Friends and Family Test was 1,680,812 with 179,024 responses recorded. The proposed contract duration is 5 years (3+1+1) and aligning with NHS terms and conditions is seen as a seamless match for the Trust's needs and industry standards.
