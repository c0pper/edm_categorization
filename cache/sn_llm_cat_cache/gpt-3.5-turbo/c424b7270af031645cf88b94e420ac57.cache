    "offer": "### TITLE:\n Provision of Inclusion Learning and Development Consultancy Contract\n\n ### DESCRIPTION:\n NHSBT is looking for a proactive partner organisation who will help to develop and deliver the inclusion training.  We believe that there are several aspects to this.<br/><br/>The selected partner organisation will work with the Forward Together Project 3 team to design and deliver a comprehensive program of learning and development that includes, but is not limited to, the following components:<br/><br/>1.\tNeeds Analysis and Learner Journey Mapping: Conduct an organisation-wide analysis to understand the specific requirements, cultural context, existing knowledge maturity and learner journey regarding key themes (e.g., anti-racism, civility, cultural intelligence, allyship, active bystander, microaggressions, inclusion, and being able to recognise and challenge discrimination). This will include mapping out the resulting inclusion competencies required for staff and managers.<br/>2.\tDesign and development: Create a learning and development offer with clearly defined learning outcomes that work for our organisation-wide audience in pursuit of achieving the outcomes shown in Figure 1 (below). The offer should include a mix of theoretical concepts, case studies, interactive exercises, group discussions, and practical applications. These should be designed for delivery in face-to-face, online, blended or hybrid modes, where appropriate. <br/>3.\tDelivery and facilitation: Deliver the training sessions either in-person, virtually, or through a blended or hybrid learning approach, considering the organisation's preferences and logistical constraints.<br/>4.\tResources: Provide comprehensive learning resources, including handouts, reference guides, and any digital resources required for the participants to further their learning and understanding.<br/>5.\tEvaluation and assessment: Embed and use evaluation mechanisms to measure the impact of the training, such as pre- and post-training assessments, attendance sheets, participant feedback surveys, post-event impact surveys, and opportunities to measure transfer from initial learning to embedded actions. The Learning Services team at NHSBT currently use the Thalheimer LTEM model and this would be our preferred methodology. <br/>6.\tTransition: Use efficient methods to ensure that product ownership and facilitation can integrate into the resources available within NHSBT (e.g., through a potential \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d approach), enabling a transition from a project-specific intervention to a Business-as-Usual arrangement.",
