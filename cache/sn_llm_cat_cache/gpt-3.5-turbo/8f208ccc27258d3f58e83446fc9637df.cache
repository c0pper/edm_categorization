We put our school motto \u2018Nil Satis Optimum\u2019, only the best is good enough, at the heart of all of our work and that means that together we work with great respect and pride. We value the uniqueness of each individual and are proud of our inclusivity, celebrating the contributions of everyone to our school. We are seeking a suitably experienced Supplier who has current experience of working within the secondary school or HE / FE marketplace, ideally with a strong operational base within the West Midlands, thus allowing for both adequate contract support and operational flexibility that is to be delivered to support the contract as and when needed moving forwards into this contract term. Whilst the monthly charge will represent one-twelfth of the contract cost, a reconciliation will take place monthly to reconcile the actual hours worked within the contract. If the hours worked are less than those budgeted for a credit will be required by the schools. This credit will be calculated by dividing the annual contract cost (fixed cost) by the number of annual input hours to arrive at a contractual cost per hour, this will then be multiplied by the number of hours due to arrive at the fiscal credit. The school require that the tendered number of hours are worked at all times and the successful contractor is expected to have a system in place to cover for both planned and unplanned leave. The basis and rationale that the Client requires is for the successful contractor to operate to at all times is being able to provide a clean School that is fit for purpose and that the Contractor is pro-active in the management of the contract, thus ensuring that all output specifications are achieved and that the required frequency are delivered.
