REQUIREMENTS 3.1   Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The VALVE,CHECK furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s).  Cage _______ ref. no.                      ;86184       96450-08F; 3.2   Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3   Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the SPCC Contracting Officer has been notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order.  When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore.  If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation.  When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1:  PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2:  Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3:  Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4:  Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5:  Part redesigned - New part replaces old.  Old part cannot replace          new. Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection.        If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a \"Warning Plate\" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.        The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.        If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned.        These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.        Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:        Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.
