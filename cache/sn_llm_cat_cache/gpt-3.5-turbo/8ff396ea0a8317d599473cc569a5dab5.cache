Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788.; PTD is required for equipments which are aquired or fabricated for Navy use, which have mechanical, electrical, or electronic components that are subject to wear and/or failure, and which will require maintenance at the Navy Organizational, Intermediate or Depot (O,I and D) level of repair. PTD shall be required for any associated design changes.  As a minimum, PTD shall consistof the specified Parts Lists (PL), Engineering Data for Provisioning (EDFP),Statement of Prior Submission (SPS) when required, and Equipment Technical Manuals, all prepared in ENGLISH.  PTD will be provided to the piece part(component) level, with EDFP provided to the piece part level. Under no circumstances will PTD to the module level be acceptable. ENGINEERING DATA FOR PROVISIONING -EDFP is technical data in support of all items contained in the PLs. EDFP is used to describe parts and equipment in sufficient detail to verify the equipment configuration and assign National Stock Numbers (NSN).  EDFP consists of specifications, standards, drawings, the necessary assembly and general arrangement drawings, scematic drawings, wiring and cable diagrams, etc. needed to indicate the physical character- istics, location and function of the item.  Engineering drawings are required as EDFP for provisioning purposes.  Requirements for these drawings do not replace drawing requirements specified elsewhere in the contract i.e., those provided in the technical manuals.  Where drawings are specified elsewhere in the contract, the contractor will provide copies for provisioning purposes.

EDFP is not required under the circumstances descibed below:   (1) EDFP shall not be required when support items are identified by a government specification or standard which completely describes the item including it's dimensional, mechanical and electrical characteristics.(2) EDFP shall not be submitted on support items that are identified to an acceptable NSN with a Type 1 item identification (DOD 4100.38), or when a statement of  prior submission has been approved.  A Type 1 item identification is a full description of an item of supply, and delineates the essential characteristics of the item by use of the approved item name, a description of the character- istics of the item, and an illustration of the item as a supplement to the description (DOD 4130.2-M definition).  If a NSN is not acceptable to the NAVY (canceled in DLSC), EDFP shall be furnished for that item. b.  EDFP SEQUENCING. Regular hard copy EDFP shall be sequenced in Provisioning Line Item Sequence Number (PLISN). 3.6   Commercial Drawings - Commercial Drawings shall be in accordance with MIL-DTL-31000 as tailored by the Block 16 Remarks of the Contract Data Requirements List.

A SPS shall provide total identification of a system or equipment as well as the procurement document number under which PTD was previously submitted.  Additionally, the contractor shall certify that the PTD previously furnished to the Navy will satisfy the PTD requirements for the system or equipment being procured. The SPS certification shall include a statement that all replacement parts are identical to those submitted under the original PTD.If  there are differences, the certification shall provide a statement as to what parts have changed and the percentage of changed parts to the total parts pop- ulation.  The Navy reserves the right to reject in full, or any part of, a SPS if it does not meet the data requirements for PTD. Upon approval by the Navy to accept a SPS with parts differences, the contractor shall provide updated provisioning lists with supporting EDFP using the Design Change Notice (DCN) process. DESIGN CHANGE NOTICE (DCN)- The contractor shall notify the Provisioning Activity (PA) of all changes, whether of a production or modification type, which are approved for incorporation into the end item. The changes to be identified can modify, add to, delete or supersede parts in the end item. When changes affect interchangeable repairable assemblies that introduce non- interchangeable parts, the contractor will identify the part number before the change as a deletion and the part number after the change as an addition. The contractor will change and document the part number of the next higher assembly and those of all progressively higher assemblies, up to the assembly where interchangeability is re-established.  PTD shall include the interchangeable assembly. EDFP is not required for deleted items.  Changes that occur after PTD has been delivered shall be documented as a revision to the applicable PLs and submitted in MIL-PRF-49506 format.  If the number of changes exceeds ten (10) line items, a hard copy and magnetic diskette PPL is required. Whenever the design changes significantly impacts the equipment, the equipment shall be provisioned as a new end item, and documented with new PLs and associated EDFP. All Design Change Notices shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements outlined in the DD form 1423.

NAVICP has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's           included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as           NAVICP does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without           purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,           most NAVICP DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item           being purchased. Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,           invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and           monitoring purposes. Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the           individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the           requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H:  Self explanatory. Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content           and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J:  Self explanatory. Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if           the title requires clarification. Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual           Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event           the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered           TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement           statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,           conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and           acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the           codes is as follows:               DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                     SS               (1)           (2)                     DD               (3)           (4)                     SD               (1)           (4)                     DS               (3)           (5)                     LT               (6)           (7)                     NO               (8)           (8)                     XX               (9)           (9)           (1)  Inspection at source.
