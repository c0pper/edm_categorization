The joint venture procurement is being run involving East Suffolk District Council, West Suffolk District Council, Babergh District Council (BDC), Mid-Suffolk District Council (MSDC) & Ipswich Borough Council.(the council listed above’) are based in central Ipswich Suffolk districts  ) All of the above contracting district councils invite suitably qualified organisations to tender for this project. 1.	Purpose1.1 Population NeedsNational Context / Evidence BaseTobacco use is the single most preventable cause of ill health in the UK - and Suffolk - and there is clear evidence that by reducing prevalence of tobacco use that health and healthy life expectancy will improve within the population (ref GBD).   Smoking is a major cause of health inequalities, with smoking rates much higher among low-income groups and among adults with a mental health condition; around 40% of those with a serious mental health condition smoke. In 2019 around 1 in 4 (23.4%) of people in routine and manual occupations smoked, compared to only 9.3% of those in managerial and professional occupations. Smoking accounts for around half the difference in life expectancy between the richest and poorest groups (ref HNA).Smoking behaviour is primarily driven by addiction to nicotine; however, a wide range of personal, social, and environmental factors interplay with this addiction to influence who starts smoking, who continues to smoke and who gives up. Tackling smoking therefore requires a comprehensive approach which incorporates a range of public health interventions at different levels to tackle the individual, social and cultural influences on smoking behaviour. Reducing smoking prevalence and the use of tobacco can help local government to 1) cut costs to local public services, 2) protect children from harm, 3) boost the disposable income of the poorest people, and 4) drive improvement across key measures of population health.1.2 National PolicyIn July 2017, the UK government published ‘Towards a Smokefree Generation – A Tobacco Control Plan for England’. This contained a vision of a smokefree generation (prevalence of 5% or lower) with a plan for action to reduce both overall prevalence and reduce the inequality gap in prevalence. Actions included a focus on prevention, supporting smokers to quit, eliminating variations in smoking rates and ensuring enforcement e.g., high duty rates for tobacco products.Additionally, The NHS Long Term Plan contained the following actions relevant to smoking:•	By 2023/24, all people admitted to hospital who smoke will be offered NHS-funded tobacco treatment services.•	The model will be adapted for pregnant mothers. •	A new universal smoking cessation offer will be available as part of specialist mental health services [2]More recently, The Khan Review: Making Smoking Obsolete acknowledged that England will miss the smokefree 2030 target by at least 7 years, and the poorest areas in society will not meet it until 2044. To have any chance of hitting the smokefree 2030 target, there is a need to accelerate the rate of decline of people who smoke, by 40%.1.3 Suffolk Context•	Smoking related illness kills 3 people every day in Suffolk, more than obesity, alcohol, road accidents and illegal drug use put together. •	Almost 1 in 5 adults in Suffolk smoke (16.0%) and it is estimated that there are currently 107,914 adult smokers in Suffolk.•	In Suffolk smoking is associated with 1,549 hospital admissions and over 1,100 deaths (approximately 15% of all deaths) every year.  •	Smoking prevalence in Suffolk has decreased in recent decades.  However, those living in deprived areas in Suffolk have higher levels of smoking prevalence, estimated to be at 30%. •	Smoking accounts for about half of the difference in life expectancy seen between the lowest and highest income groups.•	Smoking prevalence in Suffolk (16.0%) is similar to the East of England average (15.6%) and national average (15.9%) (ref PHOF).  •	Suffolk Health and Wellbeing Board have agreed to deliver recommendations in the Aspiring to Be a Tobacco Free Suffolk report which set out actions for Prevention, Protection and Cessation. This service specification will be required to support these objectives.•	Smoking is significantly higher among routine and manual worker populations. Although Suffolk is statistically similar (29.1%) to England (24.5%), Ipswich presents a significantly higher proportion of routine and manual workers who smoke (42.5%) compared to England and the East of England (ref PHOF).(All reference provided in reference section below)1.4 Service AimsThe provider must be able to deliver a Suffolk wide, comprehensive, core stop smoking service that allows clients access to behaviour change information, guidance, and support via various communication formats throughout their quit journey, and in turn, reducing the number of people in Suffolk who smoke. •	The provider will deliver stop smoking, behaviour change support for the term of 6 months (October 1st, 2023 – 31st March 2024) with the possibility of extension.•	The provider shall ensure that all practitioners who conduct community-based stop smoking behaviour change support are appropriately trained to deliver the programme as per NICE Guidance NG209 and subsequent Quality Standard QS207 Quality statement 1: Identifying people who use tobacco | Tobacco: treating dependence | Quality standards | NICE where applicable.•	The provider will be responsible for all elements of service delivery seen in the ‘Scope’ section of this specification.  •	The provider must ensure that all aspects of the service it provides to members of the public is fully accessible to all communities and those with protected characteristics.•	The provider must use targeted engagement with clients from high-risk population groups, such as routine and manual workers, and areas of socioeconomic deprivation to a) encourage and enable those individuals to stop smoking b) improve their health and wellbeing by stopping smoking and c) understand levels of engagement from these groups and monitor the barriers to stopping. •	The Provider shall work with the District and Borough Leads to access the Feel-Good Suffolk digital platform for inputting client quit data or create a robust reporting feedback loop to collate necessary data requirements. The provider will need to collect and report accurate data through an agreed method.2.	ScopeService descriptionThe service will provide targeted high-quality provision, offering a behaviour support programme for people who want to stop smoking. The service must be compliant with NICE guidance NG209 and aim to further contribute to the evidence-base in smoking cessation and behaviour change support. A description of the service model is not given here to allow for innovation and flexibility.

The limitations of this approach have led to the decision to commission a partner organisation via this procurement to develop and lead the delivery of Bolder Healthier Workplace Champions Workstream going forward.The Council will be using its free to use e-tendering system (in-tend) for the administration of this procurement process and potential suppliers must register with the system to be able to express an interest.

Given the highly centralized nature of systems in Sudan, the disruption had a profound impact, virtually halting the wheels of life and production. This upheaval created significant gaps in the supply chain, affecting the availability of essential goods and services across the entire country. Start-ups and small businesses, predominantly operated by young entrepreneurs, bore the brunt of the crisis. Many fell victim to looting or complete loss, while others faced the harsh reality of unemployment. The Sudanese labour market is undergoing a noticeable downturn in employment opportunities, stemming from the suspension of operations in most factories, institutions, and both public and private companies in Khartoum. Consequently, emerging business owners find themselves grappling with a formidable crisis, yet they persist in their efforts to sustain or revive their ventures amidst challenging circumstances.In response to the current situation, it is imperative to re-evaluate our approach to providing support and networking. This reassessment should align with the demands of the current stage, aiming to assist young individuals in overcoming and navigating the prevailing challenges effectively. The required form of support and networking involves establishing direct connections with banks, microfinance institutions, investors, organizations, entities, companies, and stakeholders, including Chambers of Commerce and license and facility donors, to facilitate the initiation or continuation of emerging businesses.The overarching goal of this strategic support and networking initiative is to empower young people with innovative ideas and burgeoning businesses, enabling them to progress steadily. This, in turn, contributes to fostering positive change and growth at both a personal level and on a broader scale within the country. The ultimate aim is to enhance and facilitate the creation of improved job opportunities for the youth of Sudan. In navigating the multifaceted challenges of supporting young entrepreneurs and start-ups in a conflict-affected region like Sudan, this strategy takes into account the distinctive dynamics of the environment to ensure a comprehensive and effective approach.The purpose of this consultancy service is to provide training for Sudanese youth to empower entrepreneurship in addition to developing networking skills and strategy through engagement events.",79410000,Business and management consultancy services,34.3726,75210000,Foreign affairs and other services,22.5334,79420000,Management-related services,7.1276,72220000,Systems and technical consultancy services,6.953,73220000,Development consultancy services,4.7211,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/britishcouncil/aspx/ProjectManage/3295

Background to the assignment The British Council started working in the area of TVET in Botswana in 2020. In 2023, the Green Skills Benchmarking Tool was piloted in Botswana along with Morocco, Tanzania and England. The tool applied aimed to help governments, employers, and TVET providers assess how their TVET system can support the transition to a more sustainable and greener economy. The tool takes a broader view of what creating a TVET system that supports the green transition entails, looking beyond the narrow focus on occupational skills for particular 'green' industries. A wider, systems strengthening perspective, which also considers occupations in non-green industries has been taken. The tool consisted of 60 questions, grouped around the following sections:•	Policy coherence and vision  •	Labour market intelligence & skills anticipation  •	Employer engagement •	Curriculum and assessment •	Learner engagement and support •	Institutional strengthening and TVET workforce development •	Financing •	Quality assurance, monitoring, and evaluation A comparative analysis report has been produced and can be viewed here.The report highlights specific findings from the research countries and provides high level recommendations based on the above-mentioned research sections. With this assignment we are taking this work further, contextualising the recommendations and developing a roadmap to help the local stakeholders identify practical next steps Botswana can take to enhance their TVET system and ensure an effective transition to a green/blue economy. Scope To achieve the assignment objective, it is proposed that a team of a local expert and a UK TVET consultant work collaboratively between January and March 2024, to design of a roadmap (including stakeholder engagement) for greening TVET in Botswana, outlining short-, medium- and long-term priorities at policy, industry and implementation level and the respective action plan.The following activities will form part of this assignment:  1.	Review the findings of the benchmarking tool report produced for Botswana, identifying potential gaps and/or inconsistencies and producing a plan for addressing these. This will include desk research and consultations with local stakeholders (both online and in person) and includes arranging meetings and discussing information with key national informants to validate information previously shared or collect new information if needed.  2.	Production of a revised short report summarising the key findings of the benchmarking exercise and own findings outlining strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threads for the TVET sector in Botswana in the transition to green economy.3.	Development of a roadmap, including agreed objectives, outputs, outcomes and roles and responsibilities at policy, industry, and implementation levels4.	Design and deliver a one-day face-to-face interactive workshop with key stakeholders in Botswana to triangulate the findings of the benchmarking research and to validate the proposed roadmap.  5.	As part of the local stakeholder engagement investigate local partners appetite for investment and partnership projects with British Council and make recommendations for future interventions which British Council could potentially support through its programmatic work in Botswana in the area of greening TVET.Deliverables There are four main deliverables:  •	A short, revised report, providing a SWOT analysis in relation to greening TVET sector in Botswana. (Maximum 10 pages)   •	A roadmap for greening TVET in Botswana, outlining short-, medium- and long-term priorities and action plan including objectives, outputs, outcomes and roles and responsibilities of local stakeholders at policy, industry, and implementation levels.•	An interactive one-day workshop with key national stakeholders to triangulate the findings of the SWOT analysis and to validate the proposed road map. •	Outline of potential opportunities for partnership project(s) between the British Council and the local stakeholders in green skills transformation, and proposed implementation planOutcomesThe expected outcomes from this assignment include: •	Improved and shared understanding of the current landscape in respect of green TVET in Botswana, including existing models of practice, strengths, and weaknesses of the current system. •	A clear, shared vision of the direction of travel and strategic planning, including agreed objectives, outputs, outcomes and roles and responsibilities at policy, industry, and implementation levels.•	Enhanced relationships with key stakeholders in Botswana •	Improved awareness of the British Council’s offer in TVET by the local stakeholders",75210000,Foreign affairs and other services,45.6199,79410000,Business and management consultancy services,14.0667,73210000,Research consultancy services,7.8803,73220000,Development consultancy services,4.678,71310000,Consultative engineering and construction services,3.4275,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/britishcouncil/aspx/ProjectManage/3279

(NB. We require proposals to cover all activities required to deliver all three phases, but Phases 2 and 3 will only commence upon successful completion of Phase 1 outputs.)PROJECT DURATION	Mar 2024 – Dec 2024PROPOSED TEAMThis project can be carried out by a small team of academics and/or practitioners with a strong track record in assessment from an academic institution that will be selected through a competitive selective call for proposals.  Suitable applicants will be able to demonstrate expertise and experience in following areas-	Teaching and learning of reading, research into reading comprehension for young learners, particularly for learners in the development contexts in which the test is likely to be used-	Clear understanding of the context for Phase 2 outputs (South Africa) as well as the wider context -	Demonstrated experience and expertise in language test development and researchIf the applicant has suitable testing experience in other subjects, but language test experience is a gap, there are several UK language testing research centres who could potentially partner on this project. If this is of interest, please contact us before the clarification question deadline.In addition to expertise in assessment, the team must also have a comprehensive understanding of the complexities, issues, and risks involved in conducting assessments in a low-resource development context where English is taught as an Additional Language, and a sound knowledge of the South African context and relevant features of the situation in relation to the education system and development partners working to support it.EXPECTED OUTPUTSPhase 1 (a report):a. Literature review of current theory and practice of primary aged pupil exams relevant to low resource contexts such as those in SSA, including considerations such as cognitive load, multilingual approaches, and different aspects of validity. Suppliers should consider the Socio-Cognitive Model as described in Chalhoub-Deville and O’Sullivan (2020)  as this is widely used by the British Council and other test developers. The Khalifa and Weir (2009)  reading model should also be addressed in the review.b. In light of this literature review, analyse and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of tests used in the SSA development sector (including EGRA and the BLF pupil test). c. Adapt and/or design a theoretical approach for a comprehensive English Language Reading Test for primary school pupils in development projects contexts. This must be based on a clear validity model emerging from the literature review in (a) above. Phase 2 (a test specification):a. Based on the theoretical approach, adapt/design a set of test specifications (overall test spec. identifying target reading construct, number of tasks and items, formats, etc), as well separate detailed task/item specifications which provide the detail for item writers to develop specific content that is predictable in terms of difficulty and fits the overall approach and reading skills that different task formats may need to focus on.Phase 3 (a set of validated test materials):a. Use this test specification to develop test materials and scoring rubrics for P1-7 pupils in South African state schools that align with the national curriculum and learning outcomes that are age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and suitable for delivery at scale. (If feasible, include EGRA ORF questions in the test package to evaluate concurrent validity.) b. Throughout the test development process, collect appropriate evidence to assess specifications, content, and items for validity, reliability, and effectiveness in evaluating pupils' reading skills in line with the national curriculum and stated learning outcomes.

The tool is designed to support governments in demonstrating and measuring progress in the transition to a greener society and will inform the enhancement and formulation of appropriate policy initiatives, identify exemplar areas of practice and success and shape Going Global Partnership interventions to help capitalise on strengths and address any gaps. It is proposed that a green skills benchmarking exercise takes place in Mozambique between December and February, which will be followed by the design of a roadmap (including stakeholder engagement) for greening TVET in Mozambique, outlining short-, medium- and long-term priorities. The following activities will form part of this assignment:  1.	Working with the UK consultant on conducting an assessment of TVET system in Mozambique using the Greening TVET benchmarking tool, through desk research and consultations with key national stakeholders (both online and in person). This includes arranging meetings and interviewing key national informants to collect and validate information for the self-assessment tool. 2.	Delivering a one-day face-to-face interactive workshop with key informants in Mozambique to triangulate and validate the findings. The UK consultant will support the design of the workshop. 3.	Work with the UK consultant on development of a report analysing the findings of the benchmarking exercise (including the ranking for each question in the tool, discussed and agreed by key stakeholders during the workshop), outlining strengths and opportunities for greening TVET in Mozambique, capturing examples of good practice which illustrate how the country is enhancing, or plans to enhance, its TVET system to ensure it supports transition to a green/blue economy, and making recommendations for potential British Council supported projects in this space as well as suggesting enhancements/refinements to the tool.4.	Support the UK consultant in development of a roadmap (including stakeholder engagement) for greening TVET in Mozambique, outlining short-, medium- and long-term priorities.       Overview of taskThe task focusses on five interrelated activities:1.	Briefing from the British Council.

Cameras should be located within the CMR facing the door area, providing. b.	recognisable* images of anyone entering the room and the general working area  of the CMR, including access to cabinets and to mini safes containing cabinet keys. In many cases, more than one camera will be needed to ensure complete coverage of all the working spaces. c.	The fire door must also be included in the internal camera coverage. d.	Where necessary, illumination will be required to provide a useable CCTV image during periods of low or zero light. This will ideally be in the form of Infrared lamps. e.	The cameras and recorders should be supplied with an uninterruptable power supply. f.	The recording software should be capable of using video motion detection to trigger recordings. g.	The capacity of the CCTV recording must meet the corporate record retention schedule, which is 90 days for a CMR. Where local legislation stipulates a shorter retention period, this period is applied. However, there should be evidence available to this requirement. h.	CCTV system and recording equipment should be rack mounted in the server room. i.	Appropriate password protection should be in place to access the CCTV recordings, and access to them must be restricted to authorised staff, which is included on the authorisation log and/or CCTV code of practice.  j.	CCTV must be clearly sign-posted via corporate notices wherever used.  *A Recognisable image is achieved by capturing the image of a person which occupies at least 50% of the screen height on a monitor.  ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM An automated access control system is required to permit access into the CMR   1.	Each authorised individual must be given biometric access. 2.	An electronic lock controlled by the access control system secures the door when not in use. Preferably this should be an electronic strike lock. If a maglock is used it must be a high security model with a minimum holding force of 510kg or 5000 Newton’s. The door should also be fail tested in case of system failure, i.e. it remains locked and closed.  Electronic strike lock is installed into the door frame and uses a latch to secure it.    When power is applied to the lock the latch releases and the door can be opened.  This provides additional security as the door remains secure even if the power is removed.  It is much harder to force this type of lock open compared to a maglock, also its more likely the intruder will have to damage the door to gain access.  The disadvantage of this lock is they take longer to install as the installer has to modify the door frame significantly and therefore are more costly.  A maglock (or magnetic lock) (see picture) is located on the top corner of a door (on the inside of the door/room not the ‘attack’ or outside of the door/room.)  A maglock uses a powered magnet to hold the door secure.  When power is removed the door can be opened, also if you apply enough force by pulling the door the lock will eventually give way without damaging the lock or door. This is the main disadvantage of these type locks.  The advantage is they are easiest and cheapest to fit. With this lock an additional physical lock is needed to ensure door remains closed if power fails during out of office hours.   There must be a means to leave the room including in an emergency. a.	If you have a maglock, there must be a push to exit button fitted on the inside of the room to allow users to leave the room. An emergency break glass unit is required to leave the room in the event of a system failure.  b.	If you have an electronic strike lock, there must be a manual handle on the door to allow people to leave the room at any time including in an emergency.  An electronic system identifies and records who opens door when entering (name, date, and time) and when the door is closed (date, time). It would also capture door opening from inside (date, time) and closure (date, time). It also captures unsuccessful attempts to open the CMR door.   There should be an alarm sounder at the entrance door which is to activate if the door is left open for longer than 30 seconds, this will alert people to close the door or to investigate who opened the door and why the door is still open.

In addition to the direct consequences of the conflict, such as physical harm to themselves, family and communities, trauma/psychosocial consequences as well as displacement from region or country, they have experienced disruption to education healthcare, and other vital services. Ukrainian children and youth are showing signs of widespread learning loss as Russia’s invasion preceded by the COVID-19 pandemic have left them facing a fourth year of education setbacks. According to UNICEF (2023) only a third of children of primary and secondary age are learning fully in-person. Another third of enrolled students are learning through a mixed approach of in-person and online, and one-third are fully remote with secondary-age students most likely to miss out.The British Council delivers education, arts, and English programmes in Ukraine. The British Council have been working in Ukraine since 1992, and every year connect with thousands of students, educators, policymakers, academics, creatives, and entrepreneurs in Ukraine. The British Council, alongside the Ukrainian Institute, managed the UK/Ukraine Season of Culture. First envisioned in 2019, the UK/Ukraine Season of Culture gave a voice to Ukrainian creatives amidst the changing needs and priorities of the Ukrainian cultural sector. In the area of youth and society, based on successful projects focusing on citizenship, social enterprise and social cohesion and resilience, the British Council is currently developing and delivering a pilot project that aims to develop to develop a suite of activities to meet the needs of a diverse cohort of young Ukrainians, either currently in Ukraine, possibly internally displaced or recently resident under Temporary Protection in three potential partner countries, Romania, Poland and Bulgaria and promote their integration in their current social contexts. The British Council is seeking to understand more fully the challenges currently being faced by young Ukrainians both in Ukraine, and those who have moved outside its borders since Russia’s invasion. Much of our programming in Ukraine has been changed significantly since 2020, as both the COVID pandemic and Russia’s invasion necessarily altered British Council operations, and now it is important to get a clearer understanding of young Ukrainians’ needs, hopes, and aspirations as they describe them. The British Council is seeking a partner to conduct research that investigates, records, and makes explicit these concerns, needs, and hopes. Through the process of listening to, and understanding, the unique challenges young Ukrainians face, this research will aid in clarifying and evidencing British Council programming, and influence our work in Ukraine, and with Ukrainians. In addition, the British Council is seeking in our partner for this research the ability for that partner to take the insights gained from young Ukrainians and hold both internal and external round table discussions with key stakeholders, to facilitate learning across the organisation from what is learned.This contract will be given to a single supplier for the provision of research, management of that research, and subsequent associated activities including, but not limited to, round table discussions, internal dialogues, associated PPT slide decks, a final report, and guidance papers.

Expansion of CAG/CTG repeats within the HTT gene cause HD. These repeats are genetically unstable, leading to dramatic changes in repeat size, biased towards expansion over an individual’s lifetime. Somatic expansion in affected tissues is thought to modify disease presentation and many genes identified in genome-wide association studies play a role in DNA repair and in repeat instability.Repeat instability, defined as gain or loss of repeat units relies on DNA repair processes although the exact mechanisms are still being elucidated. Although several DNA repair components have been implicated in repeat instability, how they work together and how potential sequence context may influence the process is unclear.Part of this project involves investigating the effects of genes associated with DNA repair on repeat instability. 10 different genes of interest have been identified and to investigate their effect on repeat instability, these genes need to be knocked-out in our custom HEK293 cell line.The requirement is for separate knock-out of 10 genes in an immortalised cell line, GFP(CAG)101, which is HEK293-derived.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Having access to modern energy sources is essential for economic development and livelihood improvement. Access to modern energy supports both income generation activities and the national development agenda through improving education, reducing indoor air pollution, and enhancing environmental sustainability. The Ethiopian energy sector faces the dual challenges of limited access to modern energy and heavy reliance on traditional biomass energy sources to meet growing demand. While Ethiopia has seen dramatic economic growth in recent years, sustaining this growth into the future will require a dramatic expansion of energy supply. Power generation for the electric grid in Ethiopia currently depends almost entirely on hydropower. There are stark differences in the rate of electricity access in urban and rural areas—in urban areas 87% of the population has access to electricity, while in rural areas electricity access remains extremely low at about 5%. Eighty-three percent of the population resides in rural areas, largely relying on traditional biomass energy sources for cooking and heating. Electricity is mostly used by urban households and small industries. Ethiopia has less than 50% electricity access currently and the government of Ethiopia has planned to achieve 100% access by 2025 with 65% from grid power and 35% from off-grid power.
Under the NEP Implementation Roadmap, the GoE accords a targeted focus for achieving universal access for all social services delivery institutions as a top priority—especially in the education and health sector. While electricity access rates achieved to date in schools and health facilities are relatively higher than for households, they remain short of providing universal access, and they will hence be given priority.
 SCOPE OF WORK, SUPPLIES, and SERVICES: 
The objective of this project is to electrify 300 households for the vulnerable youth and women in southwestern Ethiopia found in Kaffa, Konta, and Dawuro zones to enhance the livelihood of the community in the off-grid area. This tender process relates to the solar off-grid electrification of home systems.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Through the GCF Readiness project, the National Designated Authority (NDA) has conducted a study on sector prioritization for utilization of climate finance sources, in which two priority sectors are identified for mitigation: Energy, Forest and Land Use (FOLU), and two under adaptation: Food, and Water. Ministry of Finance (2021) has identified that most of the private climate financing in the past decade was dedicated to mitigation, dominated by renewable energy and sustainable transport. Despite its tremendous potential economic value, private finance flows for adaptation projects remain very limited. Private sector investment for climate finance face common issues that are centered around the risk level and familiarity with the sectors. The NDA has also conducted a study aimed at assessing appropriate provisions to encourage private sector engagement in climate change adaptation projects in Indonesia. The study could gather that the private sector investment in water, agriculture, and health sectors is quite limited. There is also the underlying cause regarding the private sector’s lack of awareness about climate change and the growing assumption putting the government as the sole responsible party.
Pursuant to one of the Readiness outcomes to encourage private sector investment in climate activities, a strategy for private sector engagement for the selected priority sectors needs to be developed.
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
GGGI seeks to contract an eligible consulting firm to develop the private sector engagement strategy for priority sectors in mitigation and adaptation, with the objective to enhance private sector engagement in financing, supporting and implementing climate actions and therefore contributing to the Indonesia’s NDC.
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
The selected Firm shall perform the following activities:
a.	Conduct initial assessment of relevant private sector actors 
b.	Conduct a situation analysis for the selected sectors 
c.	Develop the private sector engagement strategy and workplans with a clear roadmap 
d.	Lead stakeholder consultations and workshop.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
The Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources (MEMR) has requested GGGI to support the development of the “Methodology for Calculating GHG Emission Reduction and/or Increasing Carbon Sequestration in the Mitigation Action Verification Framework”. This is a strategic task that will provide a basis to increase transparency and quality of data collection on emission reductions from mitigation actions, both emission calculation, validation, and verification. This methodology will be reviewed by the methodology panel team and will be stipulated through a Decree of the Director General of Climate Change Control (Dirjen Pengendalian Perubahan iklim) under the Ministry of Environment & Forestry (MoEF). MEMR requested GGGI to help develop an overarching ‘methodology for renewable energy’ that can provide strategic direction and guidance for key sectors.   
 Developing a robust and standardized methodology for the greenhouse gas inventory of new and renewable energy sources is essential to ensure accurate and consistent emissions assessments. A reliable methodology provides a scientific framework to quantify the emissions associated with the production, distribution, and utilization of these alternative fuels. It allows for the comparison of different projects and systems, enables the tracking of emissions reductions, and facilitates the development of effective policies and regulations. A standardized methodology also enhances transparency and credibility, providing stakeholders with a common understanding of the environmental impact. It enables governments, investors, and industry players to make informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and monitor progress towards emission reduction targets. The results of this greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory methodology will be utilized for the National Referral System (SRN) and subsequently form the basis for the issuance of the Decree of the Director General of Climate Change Control (Surat Keputusan Dirjen Pengendalian Perubahan Iklim) by the MoEF on this matter. 
 The development of the Methodology to Calculate GHG Emission Reduction provides an opportunity to design a tool for capacity building for both MEMR and the private sector since the development process will include several FGDs, seminars, consultation & training. The output also includes several methodologies to calculate GHG emission reduction as a policy regulation from the issuance of the Director General of Climate Change Control, the Ministry of Forestry and Environment Indonesia (MoEF). Thus, it creates an opportunity to incorporate RE-ACT support on the capacity building and new regulation as stated in Decree of Director General of Climate Change Control (Surat Keputusan Dirjen Pengendalian Perubahan Iklim atau SK Dirjen PPI).
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
GGGI is searching for a consulting firm with experience in GHG methodology inventory assessment as technical input to government policy making and long-term planning, globally or/and specifically in Indonesia. Since the work will be undertaken in close cooperation with MEMR, GGGI and other partners, flexibility and a shared vision for the project outcome are essential. The successful consulting firm (hereinafter referred as “Consultant”) shall report to the GGGI Indonesia Energy Lead and RE-ACT Project Manager while also coordinating on a day-to-day basis with the appointed MEMR focal point(s), and where applicable cooperation with MoEF, Bappenas, and other required stakeholders.
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
GGGI will procure the services of a consulting firm with experience in GHG methodology inventory assessment as technical input to government policy making and long-term planning, globally or/and specifically in Indonesia.
The Consultant shall carry out the scope of services with the below activities: 
1.	Development of Methodologies for GHG Calculation 
2.	Training/Workshop with MEMR – DG NREEC and MOEF – DG Garbage, Waste and B3 Management (PSLB3/Pengelolaan Sampah, Limbah dan B3) and DG Control of Climate Change (PPI/Pengendalian Perubahan Iklim)

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development Secretariat (NCDD-S), as an Accredited Entity (“AE”) for direct access from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for micro sized activities up to USD 10 million investments under GCF Support, is in the process of developing project concept notes for funding from GCF. NCDD-S have developed first draft of concept note on climate resilient water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure (CR-WASH) in secondary cities of Cambodia. The concept note has received feedback from GCF. Based on the new sectoral guidelines from GCF, NCDD-S and GGGI envisage a re-think of the approach towards developing this concept note. 
NCDD-S and GGGI thus wish to identify an urban resilience Consulting Firm (hereinafter referred to as ‘Consultant’)  to (1) evaluate the resilience needs of secondary towns of Cambodia, (2) identify most vulnerable of the Cambodian secondary cities and (3) design a concept note for activities up to USD 10 M for increasing urban resilience in secondary cities aligning with GCF priorities and criteria. 
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
The Consultant shall design activities, approach and the methodology appropriate to meet the objectives of the study. The methodology and the workplan will be refined in consultation with GGGI and NCDD-S team during the kick-off meeting. 
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
The following tasks / assessments are required to be undertaken by the Consultant under this assignment:
-	Collect and analyze climate change related data (climate change projections, vulnerability profiles, data on past disasters and damages, adaptation plans, ongoing resilience projects etc.) to articulate vulnerability of cities in Cambodia.
-	Identify, through a multi-criteria evaluation, the most vulnerable cities in Cambodia in need of resilient infrastructure and systems. This evaluation needs to be backed with adequate data and analysis to justify the selection of priority cities. Develop a methodology with key indicators for selecting priority cities. 
-	Engage with relevant stakeholders (Relevant Ministries, development partners, sub-national governments etc.) to validate the results of this multi-criteria evaluation. After stakeholder’s engagement, conclude a validation of the proposed weighting and cities selection with project owner.  
-	Collect additional data on infrastructure, urban development issues for three priority cities and detail the vulnerable sectors for these cities.
-	Based on this assessment, suggest at least two alternative approaches for building resilience for each of these cities. These approaches need to be aligned with what could be funded through the GCF. 
-	In making the above recommendations, the Consultant’s team shall also review the GCF guidelines, ongoing projects and nature of projects recently approved to form a view on the nature of approaches / interventions that are likely to be approved by GCF. This would inform the selection of the city and the approach to resilience.  
-	Recommend one city that in their view is most suitable for inclusion in the GCF concept note. 
-	Undertake consultations with GGGI and NCDD-S on the shortlisted cities and the approaches to select one city for development of the concept note.
-	Collect additional context specific data for the selected city which is required to satisfactorily complete the GCF concept note. 
-	Develop the draft project concept note including the log frame, activity design and other aspects required in the GCF template. 
-	Discuss this draft concept note with NCDD-S, GGGI and other key stakeholders and incorporate their feedback. 
-	Finalize the GCF concept note incorporating the feedback from the key stakeholders. 
-	After concept note submission, revise the proposal to integrate comments from the GCF Secretariat and CIC into an updated package, for up to three rounds of revisions.

The growth of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector, which makes up more than 99% of all private sector entities in the Philippines and provides employment for more than 60% of the workforce, is crucial to achieve the government’s priority of inclusive growth and job creation. In 2021, the MSME sector comprised 35.7% of the country’s economy, with manufacturing accounting for the biggest proportion at 6.9%, followed by financial services (6%) and wholesale, retail, and repair trades. 
 MSMEs are considered the backbone of inclusive growth. Accordingly, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched the Shared Service Facilities (SSF) Program to increase MSME competitiveness by addressing the limited technical and financial capacities of MSMEs. These SSFs provide grants for machinery, equipment, tools, and systems for the group use of MSMEs. 
 Since 2013, the government has invested a total of P3.2 billion (USD 58.5 million), funding the construction of 3,543 facilities and providing aid to over 600,000 beneficiaries, creating 300,000 jobs nationally. The DTI SSF Program is present in all 17 regions and has provided services to important industry clusters  including processed food, coffee, cacao, dairy, coconut, abaca, bamboo, gifts, decors, and housewares (GDH),), metal, and rubber.  In Palawan, there are seven (7) SSFs as of 2023; in Mindanao, there are around 1,210. 
 The EE&C Act (Republic Act 11285) institutionalizes energy efficiency and conservation to enhance energy supply, mitigate fossil fuel price fluctuations, and reduce carbon emissions. It establishes a framework for fundamental policies and designates the Department of Energy (DOE) as the lead agency for implementation, including raising awareness of its benefits.
 The project aligns with the objectives of the BKCF. It addresses the specific context of the Philippines, with a primary focus on MSMEs located in Palawan and Mindanao. The project’s Outputs are as follows:
1.	Output 1 - Situation analysis on potential for energy efficiency in MSMEs; in collaboration with DTI and DOE
2.	Output 2 - Identification of MSMEs buildings and walk-through energy audits
3.	Output 3 - Business case or investment proposal developed for energy efficiency project in selected MSMEs
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
GGGI is seeking to engage the services of a Firm (or consortium) with expertise in energy efficiency in the MSME sector, energy auditing, Energy Service Company (ESCO) projects, and EE&C policy analysis.
 The selected Firm shall collaborate closely with GGGI, the DTI, the DOE, and other state and non-state organizations that may become involved in this project, under GGGI's guidance. The Firm shall help the government’s ability to create and develop an appropriate institutional structure that can facilitate the expansion of possible investments.
 For Output 1, in order to perform the analysis, the Firm shall need to identify, research, and evaluate all relevant information (technical, commercial, regulatory, policy, etc.) in order to identify gaps and potential opportunities. 
For Output 2: the Firm shall gather substantial information from the List of Establishments of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) to develop a short list of MSME candidates for the energy audit component. 
For Output 3, the Firm shall develop financial models (using MS Excel) for testing various business models and their financial returns in order to enable the potential beneficiaries to make full use of the intended investments.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES
The Service Provider required will support GGGI’s work in Colombia regarding social and environmental safeguards in carbon markets for non-AFOLU sectors. The products will be developed for one project of the current portfolio: Supporting Preparedness for Article 6 Cooperation (SPAR6C) Program.
The SPAR6C Program is funded by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German government. Its objective is to use Article 6 (A6) cooperative approaches to engage the private sector in NDC implementation and to raise ambition in Colombia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Zambia. The program consists of six work packages, of which two are centrally managed and four are country driven. In the first two, best practice tools and approaches to implement cooperative mechanisms will be developed, underpinned by an international forum – a high ambition community of practice - that brings together countries and practitioners, who share the common objective of raising ambition through markets. Incountry implementation will focus on three areas of work in each of the four countries: 1) Long-term planning, 2) institutional readiness to transact, and 3) pilot design and transactions. More than eight A6 pilot programs will be implemented in Colombia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Zambia based on a toolbox of innovative guidance and approaches for transformative A6 design.
The SPAR6C Program is supporting Colombia in developing its institutional, regulatory, and technical framework and capacities to embark on Article 6 transactions of ITMOs during the NDC implementation period 2020-2030. The program's first stage was the development of a Readiness and Needs Assessment (RNA) for implementing Article 6, which examines the country's capacities and systems to consolidate a strategy and guiding principles, institutional and procedural framework and monitoring tools related to Article 6. The RNA included information about the progress of Colombia in structuring a National Safeguards System (SNS) consisting of: 1) the national interpretation of the Cancun safeguards (15 rules); (2) existing regulatory and institutional frameworks for compliance; (3) aSafeguards Information System; and 4) a Citizen Attention Mechanism. These advances occurred within the framework of the construction of the Comprehensive Strategy for Deforestation Control and Forest Management (EICDGB) in 2018 (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, 2018). Due to international advances such as the Cancun Safeguards and the advance in REDD+ projects nationally, efforts have focused on the forest sector. In 2023, these safeguards have been extended to all the AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other land use) sectors by Article 230 of Law 2294 of the National Development Plan 2022-2026. One of the needs identified in the assessment is to extend the safeguards to sectors different to forests and integrate other differential approaches (gender, LGTBIQ, age, rurality, affectation by the armed conflict, etc.), in addition to ethnicity.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Despite Government of Uganda’s (GoU) efforts, wetland degradation has continued especially in urban centres which has contributed to the reduction of green spaces in the cities and an increment in water related disasters such as floods. Among the key reasons leading to degradation is the fact that the communities and other stakeholders do not appreciate the tangible benefits from well managed wetlands. In order to address this gap, the GoU through the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) is proposing to transform some of the urban wetlands into Eco-parks. Once established, Eco-parks are expected to provide a range of ecological, social and economic benefits to the communities, the environment and the economy. It is envisaged that the transformation of Uganda’s urban wetlands into Eco-parks and planning of green areas will have long term benefits in the two cities. Key benefits will include but not limited to; greening the cities, cushioning the cities against adverse impacts of climate change, generation of income for the cities and the communities but also enhance the ecological functioning of the wetlands among others.  
Eco-parks are of great national and international importance, since their existence can help to minimise wastes, reduce soil and water pollution, provide educational facilities for visual leaning and applied research, recreation centres, greening of cities and employment opportunities as well as climate amelioration. Based on research works, Eco-parks have been used to offer a better quality of life and employment to citizens especially communities that live adjacent to these ecosystems (Refaat, 2014). 
Once established, the Ecoparks will operate on Public Private Partnership model. In this regard, Government will set up the required infrastructures including Ecotourism infrastructure, Green hotels (restaurants and kiosks), Education centers to cater for higher and lower institutions of learning, Children leisure parks etc. The established infrastructure, will then be leased out to the private sector (companies and individuals) to run them as business. Funds and taxes raised from the different enterprises will be used to sustain the Ecoparks.
In this respect, the MWE is desirous to engage a competent consulting firm (the Consultant), possessing requisite qualifications to prepare Detailed Feasibility Report (DFR) to guide establishment and development of Eco-parks in Kampala and Masaka 
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
Under the main objective of the consultancy the selected Consultancy firm shall:

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
GGGI and the Fiscal Policy Agency (FPA) implement the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Readiness and Preparatory Support project (“the Readiness Project”) in Indonesia. The FPA is the National Designated Authority (NDA) of the GCF in Indonesia. In September 2022, the FPA started a multiyear Readiness Project “Enhancing Indonesia's Access to International Climate Finance and Private Sector Investments for Climate Actions” to support the NDA in enhancing national actors’ institutional capacities to build a pipeline of climate change projects and to increase country ownership. The NDA has selected GGGI as the Delivery Partner to implement this project. Overall, the project aims to mobilize international climate finance and private sector investment to close the financing gap across the priority sectors identified by the Government of Indonesia.
 Pursuant to the overall objective of the Readiness project, Indonesia has announced prioritization for national entities to get nominated for GCF DAE accreditation, which was directed to banking and financial institutions. As intermediaries, banking and financial institutions have more flexibility to offer financing schemes for various green sectors than NGOs or private institutions with more specific mandates or expertise on certain sectors only. Typically, banks are also better equipped to price risks and estimate returns more accurately of those companies applying for green financial products. Besides, the trend of financial institutions’ engagement with GCF or other forms of climate finance is likely to continue in the near future. Regarding the accreditation of national financing institutions, currently, Indonesia has one state-owned special mission vehicle under Ministry of Finance, that is accredited as DAE, namely PT SMI, and two commercial banks as nominated candidate DAEs, including Bank CIMB Niaga.
 Entities seeking accreditation to access GCF resources will be assessed against the GCF’s Fiduciary principles and standards, Environmental and Social (E&S) and Gender Policy. As initial support, the FPA has conducted a capacity needs assessment for the three entities. Based on the findings from the assessment, relevant internal standards for nominated candidate DAEs need to be developed to support their endeavor to GCF accreditation.
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
GGGI seeks to contract an eligible consulting firm (hereinafter referred to as ‘Firm’) to develop the required internal standards for financing institution nominated as GCF DAE candidate. This is to help prepare the nominated entities for GCF accreditation process and requirements. The assignment will contribute to achieving the objectives of Indonesia’s Readiness Project on building the capacity of direct access applicants in meeting GCF accreditation standards.
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
The selected Firm shall perform the following activities:
a.	Conduct stakeholder consultations with NDA and nominated DAE candidate. 
b.	Select two types of Internal Standards Documents. 
c.	Develop the internal standards documents.
d.	Provide technical assistance to nominated DAE during the GCF accreditation process.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Study objectives to improve the NDC reporting were identified through a Readiness and Needs Assessment conducted under the SPAR6C Program, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) through the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The overall objective of SPAR6C is to improve the readiness of countries to participate in cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement by engaging the private sector and working closely with governments. SPAR6C’s activities will facilitate the development of the international carbon market created by Article 6, leading to cost-efficient, flexible, high integrity carbon markets with positive, transformational sustainability impacts.
SPAR6C will support the Government of Zambia to improve the database and calculation of emission from Forest Land remaining Forest Land (FF) on biomass changes a) caused by wood removals for fuelwood and charcoal consumption, b) in undisturbed forest areas, and c) caused by forest fires. The following two studies should be carried out:
•	Study 1:  
Assessment of biomass changes caused by wood removals for fuelwood and/or charcoal consumption
•	Study 2:  
Assessment of biomass changes in a) undisturbed forests (IPCC category: Forest Land remaining Forest Land) and b) forest areas disturbed through forest fires.
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
This assignment encompasses the scope of work to complete Study 1 “Assessment of biomass changes caused by wood removals for fuelwood and/or charcoal consumption”.
The national forest inventory describes the following five different vegetation classes: (i) Dry evergreen forest, (ii) Dry deciduous forest, (iii) Moist evergreen forest, (iv) Forest woodlands, and Forest plantations (compare IlUA report . 
 A “Demand and Supply” approach should be used to identify the impact of fuelwood consumption on the five major vegetation classes defined by the National Forest Inventory conducted in 2016. 
•	“Demand” - An in-depth analysis of current consumption of fuelwood for cooking/heating and charcoal production should be carried out. Afterwards, the area size of woodland needed to produce this amount of fuelwood has to be calculated. After the subtraction of deforested areas for fuelwood production (remote sensing analysis), the amount of fuelwood coming from forest areas remaining forest areas is estimated.  
•	“Supply” - The field survey must be structured according to vegetation types, which are suitable for fuelwood supply. After identification of fuelwood collection and charcoal production areas, socio-economic surveys will be conducted to estimate fuelwood consumption. 
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
The selected bidder shall carry out the following analysis and activities: 
1.	Demand analysis 
1.1.	Analyze the five major vegetation classes regarding their potential to provide wood for fuel or charcoal production 
1.2.	Compare the current energy mix in rural and urban areas with the national fuelwood study 
1.3.	Predict future dynamics of energy consumption 
1.4.	Analyze population dynamics
 2.	Supply analysis 
2.1.	Identify fuelwood collection and charcoal production areas for socio-economic survey

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Hydropower can offer a cost-effective electricity supply solution compared to other sources of renewable energy (solar, wind, and geothermal) required for production of green hydrogen. The renewable energy sector of Nepal is expected to grow rapidly with hydropower as the dominant form of renewable energy. The technical potential for hydropower in Nepal is 83 GW; 42 GW is estimated to be commercially exploitable. According to Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU), Nepal is expected to have an excess of 3.5 GW of electricity by the end of 2028, and Nepal has an opportunity to produce green hydrogen from its vastly available hydro power.  Given the availability of excess power and the enormous hydro potential provided by Nepal's geography, Nepal has the tallest mountains on earth all along its northern border. These mountains have glaciers that provide a more-or-less permanent source of water for the foothills and Indo-Gangetic Plain to the south. GGGI is supporting the Government of Nepal (GoN) to explore productive use of hydro power and set up the first green hydrogen and fertilizer plant in Nepal to alleviate the national need for fertilizer imports.
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
The objective of this assignment is to select a competent consultancy firm (hereinafter referred to as ‘Consultant’) to conduct a pre-Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study comprised of a technical, economic, and financial assessment of a green-fertilizer production plant coupled with a green H2 plant in Nepal. The technical specifications and the financial assumptions and considerations presented in the study should be backed by actual quotations or written/formal communication with market players, ideally global market leaders, in the technologies (vendor engagement).  GGGI will not accept assumptions and information unless they are backed by authentic quotes, technical data, and specifications provided by vendors/OEMs/manufacturing companies. 
 The assignment will build on a preliminary optioneering/review of 6 potential sites for a future green H2-fertilizer plant prepared by GGGI.
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
The selected Consultant shall produce a Pre-FEED study on a green H2-ammonia fertilizer plant in Nepal. The Pre-FEED study should focus on the types of fertilizers that are most relevant for Nepal and the bidder’s technical component should therefore indicate the types of fertilizer to be included in the study. The capital cost estimates in the Pre-FEED study should meet AACE Class 4 level of accuracy (+/- 30% accuracy).

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Burkina Faso is highly exposed to the adverse effects of climate variability and change due to its geographical location in the center of the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa. The country is exposed to several natural hazards, including droughts, floods, epidemics, heat waves, windstorms, and insect infestations. These threats impede the country's development and contribute to problems such as desertification, land degradation, food insecurity, increased poverty, and migration out of the central part of the country. Aware of these challenges, the Government developed a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) in May 2015 with the vision: ""Burkina Faso intends to better manage its economic and social development by implementing planning mechanisms and measures that take into account resilience and adaptation to climate change by 2050"". The NAP is currently under review.
In view of its low level of development, Burkina Faso expects most of these resources from its external partners. According to ECOWAS, while there is a trend towards a steady increase in climate finance flows at the global level, they remain well below the levels needed to achieve the transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient development. The monitoring of these flows is now a priority for the countries of the Region, on the one hand given the obligations of ""transparency of action and support needed and received"" stemming from the Paris Agreement (Article 9 of the Paris Agreement) from 2024 onwards and on the other hand to better coordinate climate action at the national level.
 SCOPE of WORK:
The general objective of the mission is to provide the Government of Burkina Faso an operational and dynamic system for monitoring and verifying internal and external financing investments for climate projects in general and adaptation projects in particular in connection with the mobilization of adaptation resources at the national level. This operational system for monitoring climate financial flows will be hosted on the Adaptation Information Sharing website to ensure the dissemination of information and foster communication with stakeholders on climate finance.
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
For the success of the mission, the selected bidder shall: 
1.	Collect the required data and information and process them; 
2.	Analyze the framework for monitoring financial flows in Burkina Faso as well as the barriers and assess whether or not climate finance is taken into account;
3.	Take stock of the state of internal and external climate/adaptation finance flows in the light of the guidelines set out in the national climate/adaptation resource mobilization strategy; 
4.	Organize and coordinate the contributions of stakeholders (ministry of the economy, accredited entities) to the supply of the system and confirm with the DNA/FVC and the SP/CNDD the alignment of the system with the adaptation web platform; 
5.	Propose a dynamic system for collecting/collecting and monitoring and verifying the different financing flows of climate/adaptation projects and make available to the SP/CNDD and the NDA/GCF the dedicated tools and instruments for collecting and feeding the system;
6.	Prepare the terms of reference for the training workshop for teams from the SP/CNDD, NDA/GCF, relevant financial institutions and relevant stakeholders; 
7.	Train the teams of the SP/CNDD, NDA/GCF, relevant financial institutions and appropriate stakeholders (i.e. About thirty people) on the use of the monitoring and evaluation tools for climate/adaptation finance flows developed; 
8.	Propose a user manual and test the functionality of the developed system;
9.	Accompany the SP/CNDD and NDA/GCF team over a period of six (06) months for the use of the system.

 BACKGROUND
Between 2019 and 2021, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit of Mexico (SHCP, for its acronym in Spanish) as National Designated Authority (NDA) of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), through the GCF Readiness Programme, has received support to develop the activities that enhance and strengthen Mexico’s climate finance architecture to mobilize public and private, national, and international, climate financing for mitigation and adaptation projects and programs in the country.  
In 2022, a Multiyear GCF Readiness Programme started its implementation to continue strengthening capacities of the SHCP aiming to foster the sustainable finance ecosystem within the country. As part of this Readiness, it is necessary to effectively develop and adopt a Sustainable Finance Mobilization Strategy for Mexico (EMFS, for its acronym in Spanish). The objective of this Strategy is to serve as a comprehensive framework that encompasses the initiatives, actions, and goals required to facilitate the mobilization of sustainable investments within the country and complying with best practices such as, participation on sustainable debt markets, implementation of a sustainable taxonomy, ESG policies and performance, international sustainable funding, identification and disclosure of financial risks related to climate change and biodiversity loss, capacity building on sustainability topics, financial inclusion and cross-cutting attention to gender gaps. This will support to the achievement of Mexico's climate and sustainable commitments. 
In the process of developing the EMFS, several important milestones have been accomplished. Firstly, the establishment of a technical working group was crucial for the development of the EMFS. Additionally, a methodology was created to gather data from stakeholders regarding the essential objectives and actions that the EMFS should address. These achievements were accomplished in 2022. Looking ahead to 2023, on September 18th 2023, the EMFS was published by the SHCP. Furthermore, workshops will be organized to facilitate widespread awareness and understanding of the EMFS among various stakeholders.  The EMFS will be a living document to be enhanced in the years to come, based on country needs and the feedback from stakeholders. 
One important tool for the implementation of the EMFS is the Sustainable Taxonomy of Mexico (TSM, per its acronym in Spanish). The SHCP, in collaboration with other institutions in the financial sector, including the Sustainable Finance Committee, published the TSM in Q1-2023 aiming to have a better understanding on the level of sustainability of products and services from the financial sector and real-asset sectors. The primary objective of the TSM is to provide a classification framework that establishes criteria and thresholds to assess whether a project meets sustainability standards while also ensuring compliance with the principles of ""Do No Significant Harm"", “minimum safeguards” and addressing gender gaps. The first stage of the TSM focuses on three main objectives: 1) Mitigation of climate change, 2) Adaptation to climate change, and 3) Gender equality. Sustainable assets will generate impact investment on climate change on 124 activities from six main economic sectors (agriculture, forestry and livestock; generation, transport and distribution of energy and water; manufacturing industry; construction; transport and waste management). Moreover, the objective of gender equality is cross-cutting to all sectors of the economy and will direct funding toward projects that help close gender gaps. It is intended that credit institutions, institutional investors, and issuers implement the TSM to label their sustainable investments and projects according to this classification system.     
 To promote the implementation of both the EMFS and the TSM by stakeholders, there are a number of planned activities that will be led by the SHCP to contribute with their proper adoption. These activities involve the creation and strengthening of capacities of the entities in the financial sector, generation of reliable information for the market and policy makers, and the generation of conditions that provide greater certainty and transparency to the markets in terms of sustainable finance. GGGI supports the development and implementation of such activities within the SHCP, through funding from the UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions (UKPACT). The execution of the activities will prepare stakeholders for the upcoming regulation related to the implementation of the TSM and the alignment to the EMFS. In this regard, the SHCP and users of, both, the EMFS and the TSM, require technical support to institutionalization of capacities. For this, GGGI develops three tools: a) a website aimed to create capacities on general sustainable finance topics, including the scope of EMFS (Plataforma de Finanzas Sostenibles), b) a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on the Sustainable Taxonomy of Mexico and, c) a Pilot Programme for the implementation of the TSM and the application of the EMFS on proposed institutions as described in the scope of this consultancy. 
Within the Pilot Programme and application of the EMFS, 10 institutions will be participating, and they will be chosen by the SHCP reflecting the most systematical important financial institutions of Mexico in terms of their market share in regard to the number of assets, robustness and progress in the implementation of sustainability strategies, as well as its track record in the design and development of financial products and services labelled as sustainable and eligible from the TSM. These institutions include the participation of commercial and development banks, pension funds, insurance agencies, investment funds, and public equity firms. The pool of institutions will be composed by 3 commercial banks, 3 development banks, 1 pension fund, 1 insurance agency, 1 investment fund, and 1 issuer.  
Considering the steps needed for a successful implementation of the EMFS and the TSM, GGGI is seeking to engage a competent firm (hereinafter referred to as “the Consulting Firm”) for the below objectives: 
1) General identification of the level of alignment of the sustainable vision/strategies from chosen institutions to the objectives established in the EMFS; 
2) Provide general recommendations for the alignment of sustainable strategies from chosen institutions to the EMFS; 
3) Accompany the chosen institutions on a deep dive analysis of the alignment of their green portfolio to the Sustainable Taxonomy; 
4) Identify gaps and barriers for the process of adoption of the Taxonomy by the institutions;
5) Identify the mobilized funding marked as sustainable from the public and private sector which will serve as the baseline for an effective monitoring of increments or changes in the allocation of the resources under the EMFS
  PROPOSED ACTIVITIES & SCOPE OF WORK
The selected Consulting Firm shall help in the implementation of the EMFS and the implementation of the TMS. As part of the desk analysis and information to be communicated to key stakeholders, is necessary to further increase the level of knowledge on the funding that has been mobilized and earmarked as Sustainable in Mexico. For this, the Consulting Firm shall develop a deep dive study that evidence the amount of mobilized funding allocated in sustainable projects from governments, the private, and public sector in Mexico, from 2018 until Q3 of 2023. The amount of economic resources identified as sustainable funding will serve as a baseline for measuring the effectiveness of the EMFS in the future. 
 In the same line, the Consulting Firm shall perform an assessment of the Sustainable Strategies of 10 institutions (previously chosen by the SHCP based on the importance regarding the contribution to the financial system of Mexico) to analyze the alignment to the objectives stated in the EMFS such as participation in sustainable debt markets, implementation of sustainable taxonomy, ESG policies and performance, financial risks related to climate change and biodiversity loss, capacity building, capacity building needs, and cross-cutting attention to gender gaps. From the findings of this assessment, the Consulting Firm shall provide general recommendations to each institution on how to align their corporate strategies to the EMFS. The Consulting Firm shall also provide general recommendations to the SHCP of gaps needed to be addressed by the EMFS as part of the analysis mentioned in this paragraph.  
 Furthermore, the Consulting Firm shall work hand-to-hand with the proposed institutions to determine the alignment of their portfolios and projects financed in 2022, to the TSM, as a back testing exercise or as an exercise of a potential new issuing. The back testing will cover no more than two economic sectors of the TSM per institution, and this sector will be chosen based on the characteristics of each institution’s portfolio. For this, the Consulting Firm shall conduct a revision of the portfolio to identify the most adequate projects to be assessed according to risks, amounts, sector knowledge, and other aspects that will be defined jointly by the consultant, SHCP and GGGI. The Consulting Firm shall gather all information in spreadsheets and develop a document containing the findings of the Pilot Programme including gaps, barriers and common issues that emerged during the implementation of the TSM, as well as recommendations to surpass those findings and adjust/enhance the TSM.  
 SCOPE OF WORK
Under the scope of work for this assignment, the selected Consulting Firm shall complete the following:
•	The Consulting Firm shall conduct research to identify the mobilized funding earmarked as “Sustainable, Green or Social” from the public and private sector in Mexico, from January 2018 until September 2023. For this task, the Consulting Firm may use their own databases or resources, including gathering the information from public government reports or corporate reports, as well as from public or private databases. The quantity of sustainable resources identified will serve as the baseline for the further evaluation of the effectiveness of the EMFS in mobilizing new sustainable funding. 
•	The Consulting Firm assess the sustainability strategies from 10 institutions (chosen by SHCP) to identify the alignment of the institutional vision to the objectives stated in the EMFS in terms of participation in sustainable debt markets, implementation of sustainable taxonomy, ESG policies and performance, financial risks related to climate change and biodiversity loss, capacity building on sustainable finance, capacity building needs, and cross-cutting attention to gender gaps.
•	After the conclusion of the assessment mentioned above, the Consulting Firm shall elaborate general recommendations to align the sustainability strategies from each participating institution to the EMFS. In addition, the Consulting Firm shall make general recommendations to enhance the EMFS to the SHCP, based on feedback provided by the chosen institutions.
•	The Consulting Firm shall request information from each chosen 10 institutions about the projects or investments allocated in 2022 for any of the six sectors considered in the TSM.
•	The Consulting Firm shall perform a revision of the portfolio of each of the institution to identify the most adequate activities that shall be evaluated, as well as the recommended number of projects to be contrasted with the Taxonomy. The arguments to identify the most adequate projects shall be proposed by the Consulting Firm and agreed by the SHCP and the GGGI.     
•	The Consulting Firm shall provide advisory on the process to determine the level of alignment of projects and investments to the TMS, for the relevant economic sectors identified in each institution. This process will be performed as a back testing exercise with existing projects or investments allocated in 2022. If applicable, the pilot can be utilized as a preparation for a future issuing. The information for each case will be provided by the chosen institutions. The Consulting Firm shall accompany the chosen institutions in solving questions and orienting on how to align projects and investments to the TSM. For this exercise, the SHCP with GGGI´s support has developed a Sustainable Taxonomy Implementation Excel filter (Tool) that can be used by the Consulting Firm and the institutions in determining the alignment of their portfolios or projects to the Taxonomy. The number of projects that will be assessed will be those funded by investments made in 2022, in at least 2 sectors from the TSM, per institution.  
•	Assisting each chosen institution, the Consulting Firm shall oversee the classification of the projects and investments regarding the Taxonomy, the applicability, thresholds, avoidance of significant harm, and compliance with minimum safeguards. As a result, the Consulting Firm shall identify the Sustainable Asset Ratio (amount of the sustainable aligned assets divided by the total amount of assets in the portfolio). The assistance shall be provided mostly in live sessions (virtual and in-person) and by email. 
•	Provide feedback to the chosen institutions on the alignment of the projects or investments, to the Sustainable Taxonomy. The feedback shall be provided mostly in live sessions (virtual and in-person) and by email. The sessions and narrative for conducting feedback will be led by the SHCP with the participation of GGGI and the Consulting Firm. 
•	Consolidate the findings of the process on reports, identifying barriers, gaps, frequently asked questions, and opportunities for improvement for the implementation of the EMFS, the TSM and its Tool, to be further included in the actualized versions of these frameworks. 
The deliverables related to the implementation of the TSM must be developed first, and the deliverables related to the implementation of the EMFS in second, considering the timetable and agenda of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit of Mexico. Deliverables will be owned by SHCP. The deliverables may not be published on any website, media, social network, or any other similar means of dissemination without the prior written consent of SHCP. The deliverable’s non-public content may not be published on any website, media, social network, or any other similar means of dissemination without the prior written consent of GGGI.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES
There is an increasing recognition globally to switch towards a circular economy approach to tackle the challenges of waste management. The transformation from a linear to a circular economy (CE) requires a much stronger commitment to sustainable management of waste and resources. Jordan has recognized the need for sustainable waste management and took several steps since 2015 through developing the National Solid Waste Management (SWM) strategy, The Waste Management Framework Law No.16 of 20201, and the National Green Growth Waste Management Action Plan2 regional and local SWM plans, establishing separation schemes for recyclables, and composting among other.
Oxfam, in partnership with GGGI, is implementing a 24-month project funded by the European Union aimed at identifying and assessing innovative approaches to promote circular economy in Jordan, with the following 3 main components:
1. implement demonstrative actions in Za’atari Refugee Camp and in a hosting community in the
governorate of Mafraq, piloting the separation, collection, and treatment of organic waste to
produce useful organic compost, and the reuse of treated grey water for irrigation.
2. Promote circular economy for SMEs in Jordan through the provision of sub-grants for business
models and innovative prototypes. This activity aims to provide financial and technical support
to circular/green enterprises in Jordan with projects/concepts designed to create industrial
systems change through redesign, reuse, and business model innovation.
3. Identify and develop business models targeting organic waste valorisation suitable for
subsequent investment, to provide sustainable solution for organic waste management in the
country
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
The objective of this assignment is to support the delivery of component 3, by conducting a country-wide study to assess key organic waste streams in Jordan and developing business models resulting from a feasibility study of the most valuable and effective solutions for organic waste management challenges in Jordan. GGGI is seeking to contract a Consultancy Firm to provide such services, as elaborated upon in this Request for Proposals
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES AND SCOPE OF WORK:
1) Proposed Activities for the Overall Project
The Consulting Firm shall conduct the following 3 tasks with close consultation with GGGI and OXFAM:
• Task 1: Assessment of the key organic waste streams and existing treatment methods in Jordan
• Task 2: Shortlisting of feasible organic waste management schemes for local context
• Task 3: Conduct technical and economic studies on the top 2 selected projects including a
robust and sustainable financial model and implementation modalities
• Task 4: Presentation and validation of feasibility assessments and business models to key
stakeholders
  2) Scope of Work
The Consulting Firm shall execute the following scope of work and activities for each of the three main tasks described above:
 Task 1: Assessment of the main organic waste streams and existing waste treatment methods in Jordan
• Identify key sectors and major sources that generate organic waste in Jordan, e.g. organic
municipal waste, agro-processing waste (including liquid effluents, beverages, abattoir, etc.),
agricultural waste (e.g. residue from date palm farms, olive, fruits orchards, dairy farms, manure),
food industry, tobacco, garden, yard and park waste, wood and wood products, pulp, paper,
cardboard, etc.
• Identify existing major organic waste treatment schemes (landfilling, dumping, burning,
valorisation, etc.) in place in the country, with indicative volumes treated, a brief description of
the business model and ownership.
o A sub-task for this activity should look at existing activities and projects that are
implemented to address solutions for organic waste management in Al Hussainiyat
Landfill. This includes compost activities for the dumpsite.
• Analyse value chains and map out key stakeholders. This includes sources, types and volumes of
waste, generation, storage, transport, and processing. Match with potential valorisation
solutions such as compost, animal feed, biogas, fuel biomass, green methanol, etc. This should
include a quantification of total waste available at national level (in tons) as well as an estimate
of maximum treatment potential production for each waste treatment option listed above.
• Identify work and activities that have already been implemented, ongoing or planned in relation
to the subject.
• Identify synergies of solutions for organic waste management across different administrative
bodies (e.g. GAM, MOE, and MOLA).
 Task 2: Shortlisting of feasible organic waste management schemes for local context
• Based on the finding of Task 1, and in consultation with relevant public and private
stakeholders, develop a long list (around 10) of potential organic waste management schemes
suitable for investment into valorisation of organic waste and evaluate corresponding
technologies.
• The list can contain either large scale standalone waste treatment facilities (e.g. biogas,
compost or methanol), retrofitting equipment (e.g. in an abattoir or beverage company), or a
decentralized small scale program (e.g. rural biogas program at farm level).
• Develop a decision-making/screening matrix (e.g. methane emission reductions potential,
volumes available, willingness to take part, availability of technology, market for products, likely
financial viability) and select the two most promising projects, in consultation with main
stakeholders.
 Task 3: Technical and Financial Studies
• Conduct a technical and financial study on the 2 shortlisted projects. Estimate optimal scale,
feedstock supply, preliminary site assessment, suitable technology type, transport, equipment
required, CAPEX/OPEX, market study for the products, etc. Preliminary greenhouse gas
emission savings will be calculated, and climate resilience benefits will be assessed.
• Develop corresponding sustainable business models and propose implementation modalities.
• Assess barriers and enablers to implementation (regulatory, policy, financial, logistical, and
awareness), including requirement for a gate fee, other incentives (such as feed-in tariff) and
policy measures
 Task 4: Presentation and validation of feasibility assessments and business models to key stakeholders
• Development of explanatory power points and other relevant support material to present to
key stakeholders.
• Delivery of presentations, recommendations, and validation of the results with key national
stakeholders

PROJECT BACKGROUND
GGGI has been working with the Government of Colombia to advance green growth policies and green investments through strategic partnerships such as with the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Treasury and Public Credit, and the National Planning Department (DNP), among others. Since 2014, GGGI has supported the DNP in its objective of advancing a green growth vision and transition plan for Colombia that can support climate goals and SDGs achievement. GGGI supported the development of the Green Growth Taskforce led by DNP (2016-2018), which produced solid and relevant information for the design and concertation of the Green Growth Policy- GGP (adopted by means of CONPES 3934 of 2018).
One strategic axis of the GGP aims to promote the sustainable use of natural capital, which includes the Bioeconomy as one key strategy to foster the low carbon economy through adding value to generate products, processes, and services based on the responsible use of biodiversity and biomass. In that regard, GGGI supported the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - MinCiencias, the National Planning Department, and other stakeholders in the technical design and concertation of the National Bioeconomy Mission “Para una Colombia Potencia viva y diversa: hacia una Sociedad impulsada por el conocimiento”.
Besides, GGGI was awarded by the UKPACT program in Colombia to develop the project “Accelerating the development of new bioeconomy businesses and enhanced capacities for green jobs promotion and increased climate action ambition from policy implementation and integration”, in which a Bioeconomy Accelerator Mechanism is created and will enhance the capacity of bioeconomy business and strengthen the capability of MinCiencias to meet their target of 126 and 500 bioproducts endorsed by 2022 and 2030, respectively. Complimentarily, a knowledge-sharing component will disseminate case studies, lessons learned, best practices, and recommendations.
In that regard, GGGI, with Minciencias’ support, launched the third version of the Bioeconomy Projects Acceleration Mechanism – MAPBIO call, receiving (12) proposals that were evaluated through a multicriteria analysis by GGGI, Minciencias and INNpulsa, and selecting (2) enterprises as beneficiaries.
GGGI is working with Bioingredientes Amazonicos, a Company based in Putumayo, Colombia, that aims to produce and merchandise natural oils from buriti, cacay and seje in the Amazon Basin. GGGI is supporting Bioingredientes Amazonicos in strengthening the market strategy, validation of the functionality and security of the ingredients, and the legal requirements to access the American, Ecuadorian, and European markets. The present project is intended to enhance the efficacy and safety demonstration of three (3) natural oils

Analyze current legal and regulatory environment and identify and recommend solutions for eliminating gaps, conflicts, overlaps and improve inter-sectoral coherence to allow the construction sector to fulfill their pledge in reducing CO2 emissions and create legal and regulatory environment that incentivizes energy efficiency in the construction sector. 
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES FOR THE OVERALL PROJECT  
The work shall begin in December 2023 for a duration of up to two months. The Firm shall be responsible for conducting cross-sectorial legal analysis for coherence and promoting energy efficiency in the building sector in consultation with key stakeholders and work closely with GGGI and GIZ during the contracting process. The Firm, as a registered professional firm with knowledge of and expertise in Mongolian energy sector, construction, energy and construction regulatory environment shall analyze current legal environment, identify gaps, overlaps and conflicts, and propose appropriate options, solutions and approaches. It is the Firm’s role to take all action and carry out legal analysis in consultation with and subject to the approval of key stakeholder and where necessary with GGGI/GIZ. This shall be done by conducting discussions and stakeholder interviews, round table discussions and workshops with sector stakeholders such as Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), MCUD, Construction companies, Construction development center, energy Auditors and the local government of Ulaanbaatar. 
 SCOPE OF WORK
Under this assignment, the Firm shall cover the scope of the cross-sectoral legal analysis for energy efficiency and/or conservation in the construction sector as described below.
Part 1. Analysis of the legal environment:
•	Review and analyze current circumstances, including legal, institutional, regulatory framework for energy efficiency and conservation in the construction sector. This includes energy, construction and building energy efficiency (sub)sectors. 
•	Conduct a comparative analysis of the regulations pertaining to energy-saving initiatives in the construction sector, as delineated in the national-level legal documents of Mongolia. 
–	Analyze coherence, gaps, overlaps among/between key legal and regulatory documents across subject (sub)sectors. The analysis should include institutional arrangements and coordination and coherence among key institutions. The NDC and Government policy on Construction sector includes targets and actions for energy efficiency in the construction sector. However, progress remains unsatisfactory, partially due to the inadequacy of legislation governing matters related to the enhancement of building energy efficiency. Moreover, despite the update of the norm pertaining to the overall enclosure of buildings that ensures heat consumption (Building code 23-01-09) within the Mongolian building code, there remains a deficiency in legal regulations aimed at improving the energy efficiency of existing construction and facilities.
–	Determine how relationships concerning the construction sector, including energy conservation in precast panel buildings, are regulated within the framework of the Law on Energy Conservation, Law on Construction, Law on Urban Development, Law on Housing, and other relevant construction sector legislation and regulations. 
–	Identify inter-sectoral relationships, particularly those involving construction, energy, social health, and more, concerning construction energy conservation.
–	Evaluate the legal environment for implementing the criteria for products and policy impact, as reflected in Provision 4 of the ""State Policy on the Construction Sector,"" including financing aspects.
–	Determine necessary legal provisions to support the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions to Implement the Paris Agreement.
Part 2. Findings and recommendations:
•	Summarize lessons learned from other countries in ensuring coherence and interplay for facilitating and promoting energy conservation and energy efficiency in the construction sector.
•	Prioritize the gaps, overlaps, conflicts that need resolution first to facilitate practical implementation.
•	Present a clear conclusion and recommendations of the existing legal and regulatory environment and propose clear steps and phases. Where necessary provide recommendations for updating/revising key sectoral legislation, including but not limited to Energy conservation law, Construction law, Energy law etc. 
•	Recommend phased approaches on resolving the conflicts, filling in gaps and removing the overlaps. 
Working Arrangement
The project team and Project Steering Committee will be responsible for all final approvals pertaining to this contract.
The Firm shall prepare documents in English and Mongolian that are of professional quality in terms of grammar, style, and formatting, reflecting the standards of comparable documents in the field, in accordance with GGGI’s specifications

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
GGGI has received a Detailed Preparation Phase (DPP) grant from the Mitigation Action Facility (MAF) to prepare the complete technical feasibility and relevant studies for the implementation of the solar district heating project in Mongolia. 
The MAF Facility is a funding organization that efficiently distributes and mobilizes finance for carbon-neutral development. The MAF facility offers funding for finanical and technical support  to partner countries to meet their climate goals.
The proposed project aims to transform Mongolia’s heating sector by demonstrating the applicability of renewable energy technologies for district heating systems and supporting the adoption of a clean heating policy, investment and financial support plans and mechanisms to scale up public and private sector investments in clean technologies for district heating. The Project will support Mongolia to achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitment to reduce emissions from energy production by 32% by 2030 and create the conditions for further ambition in subsequent NDCs. 
 In collaboration with the Ministry of Energy (MoE), Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), and Governor Office of Dornogovi province and GGGI have discussed to create the project titled “SHIFT – Scaling up clean Heating Investments to Facilitate energy Transformation” to pilot this solar district heating project and remaining components highlighted below. 
The project includes the following three components: 
 Component 1 – Pilot solar district heating (SDH) project in Sainshand city, Dornogovi Province of Mongolia
This component includes an approximately 10 Megawatt (MW) SDH pilot project that will provide at least 20% of heat demand to Sainshand city by potentially modifying and hybridizing the currently existing facilities of Chandmani Ilch LLC, the operator of the coal heat only boiler in Sainshand city, Dornogovi Province. The aim of the pilot project is to demonstrate the viability of the technology in the Mongolian context and confirm the key requirements for the business model and financial mechanism to enable further scaling up.
Component 2 – Adoption of a clean heating policy and investment plan and financial mechanism (clean heating payment guarantee) 
The Project will support the adoption of a clean heating policy building from the experience gained in the pilot project. The policy will include an investment pipeline to enable further scale up of clean heating. Preliminary analysis shows that the investment costs for solar district heating and conventional coal district heating technologies are fairly competitive, however, the current coal inputs in the country are highly subsidized, and upfront costs are higher for SDH systems. The private sector is interested in investing in clean heating, but in this context require improved financing terms to ensure they can recoup their investment while further improvements to the enabling environment are made and investors’ confidence in the market shall increase.  
 Component 3 – Capacity building to support the design, development, financing, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of SDH systems and awareness raising
The Consulting Firm is expected to prepare a comprehensive feasibility study for the pilot SDH project in Sainshand considering full technical design of the pilot project in the chosen location, financing considerations, and evaluations of various costs and benefits the project may bring including environmental and social costs and benefits. Such benefits should be calculated in the format of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction assessment to define the refined GHG emissions reduction estimation for the project.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES
Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are dispersed across the world’s largest ocean and while generally small in land area, have large oceanic resources and are highly diverse geographically, economically, ecologically and culturally. PICs are highly exposed to the adverse effects of climate change such as tropical cyclones, sea-level rise, droughts and increasing temperatures which are negatively impacting their economies, human and physical capital, and long-term resilient development. Access to finance for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) thus needs to be accelerated and funds mobilized and translated into project implementation with urgency. However, despite some success in project approval, the scale and pace of financial flows in the region is not commensurate with the existential threat posed by climate change to Pacific nations. Mobilisation and implementation of climate finance is beset by various challenges: international development and climate finance architecture is complex, there are data gaps for design of mitigation and adaptation projects and high transaction costs and small project sizes make it difficult to attract investments. 
A major barrier to access, absorb and deliver climate finance is limited preparedness and capability in key institutions such as government ministries, national funds, regional and national accredited entities and development banks. This means that even when climate finance is approved there can be considerable delays in deploying this funding. Lessons learnt from completed climate change projects are also not collated, shared nor proactively utilized to inform new projects. New mandates for fast-tracking climate finance delivery and implementation stemming from COP26 signalled that increased finance flows are about to be available to SIDS. PICs must be able to seize this opportunity. The next five years is therefore critical for unlocking access to finance in PICs and supporting them to strengthen absorption and delivery capacity to enable implementation before 2030.
For this reason, a program was developed “Strengthening Institutional Capability to Access, Absorb and Deliver Impactful Climate Finance in the Pacific” by the Global Green Growth Institute and the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office of the Government of the United Kingdom and funded by the UK as part of the SIDAR Programme.
The Programme aims to increase PICs’ resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change and reduce their CO2 emissions in line with National Adaptation Plans and NDC commitments through enhanced capacity and institutional capability to improve access to climate finance and strengthen their absorptive capacity for efficient delivery of impactful climate change programmes. Its two main outputs are:
1)	Six Long-term embedded technical advisors to strengthen institutional capability to access, absorb and deliver impactful climate finance
2)	Strategic feasibility studies to strengthen long-term climate finance implementation and knowledge sharing
The two studies that are being delivered under this program are i) Pacific Technical Assistance Call-Down Facility Scoping Study and ii) Pacific Climate Finance Evidence and Knowledge Platform.  
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT
i) The Pacific Technical Assistance Call-Down Facility study will aim to establish the demand and modalities for a Pacific Call Down Facility to provide demand-driven, pre-paid specialized short-term technical assistance for climate change projects. The aim of the scoping study is to examine the options and modalities for a technical assistance facility. The technical assistance provided by the facility could meet needs such as up to 12 weeks of technical support on coastal defenses, renewable energy, proposal grant applications for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) or the Adaptation Fund. The technical assistance facility should be able to be accessed quickly and efficiently by PIC governments and other eligible institutions. 
The mechanism would ideally be pre-funded so that eligible institutions can submit a request for rapid access specialist TA to help them deliver climate finance projects. The aim is for the facility to enable access to and deploy of assistance rapidly, within 1-2 months of the need being identified. The Facility would be accessible to ODA eligible PICs and associated organisations. 
 ii) The Pacific Climate Finance Evidence and Knowledge Platform study will aim to assess demand and modalities to improve knowledge sharing and lessons learning from climate change projects in order to promote replication and scale up. 
 The underlying assumption for the study is that there is a growing body of knowledge from the implementation of climate change projects in the Pacific. However, this information is not readily accessible to climate change practitioners designing, developing, and implementing projects in PICs. This scoping study will assess how climate change project specific lessons, for example from end of programme/project evaluations, workshops and reporting, can be pro-actively disseminated. 
   SCOPE OF WORK
The Incumbent service provider named consultant in this ToR shall undertake the scoping study including;
 For i) the Pacific Technical Assistance Call-Down Facility study;
• An analysis of demand for a call-down facility 
• Review of existing mechanisms and their effectiveness incorporating recent reviews mechanisms such as that of the RTSM – Regional Technical Support Mechanism. Lessons learnt and best practice of existing mechanisms should also be captured.  
• If a new mechanism is proposed how it would be designed and function (to note the presumption is to work with existing mechanisms) 
• Costed options for delivery will be prepared (including a do-nothing option, and considering governance and accountability) 
• How to work with regional partners
 For ii) Pacific Climate Finance Evidence and Knowledge Platform;
The scoping study will examine how the lessons learnt can be made easily accessible and disseminated to climate change practitioners across the region including;
A review of the existing platforms for knowledge sharing and explore if a new mechanism could contribute in this space.  
The study will assess whether an existing regional institution(s) can act as a repository for key evaluation and learning documents and analyse such data and proactively share key lessons to promote replication and scale up. 
The scope for lesson learning with other regions, notably the Caribbean 
 The activities are described in detail below:
Activity 1: Kick-off meeting with GGGI and the British High Commission to validate the inception report agreeing on scope and expectations of the study.
 Activity 2: Scoping study for a draw down facility 
2.1 Review of existing mechanisms and their effectiveness

GGGI Indonesia is inviting eligible firms/entities to submit their proposals for the following scope of work:
 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
GGGI and the Fiscal Policy Agency (FPA) implement the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Readiness and Preparatory Support project (“the Readiness Project”) in Indonesia. The NDA has selected GGGI as the Delivery Partner to implement this project.    
  The Government of Indonesia has outlined the country’s transition to a low emission and climate-resilient future, which stipulates that Indonesia will reduce its GHG emissions by 31.89% compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario in 2030 solely with domestic resources, and 43.20% with international assistance. Indonesia has set five prioritized sectors for NDC under mitigation: Energy, Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU), Waste, Forestry and Land use (FOLU), and Agriculture.  To achieve its NDC commitment, Indonesia will also require significant technological advancement through international support for technology transfer, as well as finance and capacity building, emphasizing the need for technological innovation via multi-stakeholder engagement. Indonesia had its First Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) in 2010, focusing on mitigation, followed by the Second TNA in 2012 covering both mitigation and adaptation. The outcomes of ongoing TNAs that have been carried out since 2019 will guide technology development and transfer to support NDC implementation.  Additionally, the Government of Indonesia, through the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, is currently developing strategies for technology development and transfer. It will identify and analyze needs for adaptive and applicable technology in the NDC mitigation and adaptation sector to improve the effectiveness of NDC programs/activities, including the development and application of climate-adaptive green technology for remote areas. 
A strategic approach to guide investments in priority sectors is urgently needed to inform and enable state and non-state actors to better allocate their resources. Through the implementation of the Readiness Project, the NDA has conducted a study on sector prioritization for utilization of climate finance sources, in which two priority sectors are identified for mitigation: Energy, Forest and Land Use (FOLU), and two under adaptation: Food, and Water. A concept note reflecting a programmatic approach will be developed focusing on the priority sectors to access GCF funding. To better equip the development of programmatic approaches, both private sector investment and robust projects are needed, which includes using sound technologies with the highest impact.
As a part of the Readiness Project activities to enhance the enabling environment for GCF programming in low-emission investment, a Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) will be developed to identify and assess environmentally sound technologies that will, within national development objectives, reduce the impact of climate change in those prioritized sectors: Energy, Forest and Land Use (FOLU) for mitigation, and Food, Water security for adaptation. 
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
GGGI seeks to contract an eligible consulting firm to develop technology needs assessment for priority sectors in mitigation (energy and FOLU) and adaptation (food and water security). The TNA aims not only to identify the most important technologies for the prioritized sectors, but also to identify and analyze the barriers that hinder the successful deployment and diffusion of the technologies. 
Overall, the objectives of the assignment are:
1.	Through participatory processes, to identify and prioritize gender responsive technologies that can contribute to mitigation and adaptation goals for the sectors Energy, FOLU, Food, and Water;
2.	To identify barriers hindering the acquisition, deployment, and diffusion of the selected prioritized gender responsive technologies;
3.	To develop action plans and strategies specifying activities and enabling frameworks to overcome the barriers and facilitate the transfer, adoption, and diffusion of the selected prioritized gender responsive technologies.

  PROJECT BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES
CONTEXT OF THE PROGRAM: GGGI has been a trusted advisor to the Government of Colombia (GoC) for more than a decade on the planning, structuring, and transitioning to an environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economy. This has included giving valuable advisory support and capacity building to National Public Entities as the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, and the National Planning Department, among others, and to Subnational Public Entities as the Governments of Antioquia, Meta, Nariño, and Guaviare, also including the Departments of the CORPOAMAZONIA jurisdiction. 
In October 2022, the Global Green Growth Institute was awarded funding by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) of the government of the United Kingdom to implement a project titled “Colombia – UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions”.
This project delivers demand-driven technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), the Institute for Planning and Promotion of Energy Solutions for Non-Interconnected Areas (IPSE) and selected private-sector developers to advance Colombia´s just energy transition and provide sustainable and affordable energy solutions to vulnerable rural communities and households. 
Project Description:
The adoption of renewable energy has the potential to stimulate private investments, foster economic expansion, create employment opportunities, and enhance access to clean, dependable, and cost-effective electricity. Collaborating with GGGI, the Colombian government is actively involving rural communities, particularly ethnic and marginalized groups, that are frequently excluded from decision-making processes, policy development, funding allocation, and equitable distribution of benefits. With the assistance of the UKPACT program, GGGI supports the Colombian government in its endeavors to guarantee that historically marginalized communities in Colombia also benefit from renewable energy projects and are part of Colombia’s just energy transition.
The Institute for Planning and Promotion of Energy Solutions for Non-Interconnected Zones (IPSE) is developing a set of projects for the 2023 budget period, which aim to implement energy solutions with Non-Conventional Energy Sources (NCRES) and hybrid types to expand coverage, as well as to improve the existing electricity infrastructure for the provision of electricity service in non-interconnected areas.
Electrification efforts are hindered by the lack of technical and institutional capacity of public energy operators: after public energy generation assets are built, their precarious ownership is transferred through a gratuitous loan contract to the local public energy company. Experience has shown that limited technical and institutional capacity of operating companies results in the deterioration of the installed systems and energy shortages for the population.
According to the 2022-2026 National Development Plan (NDP), the Government of Colombia will seek to advance in the coverage of energy services through 20,000 new Energy Communities (EC) users of Non-Conventional Renewable Energy Sources (NCRES), where individuals, households, businesses, and organizations will collectively produce, consume, and manage local energy resources.
In recent years, GGGI has provided technical assistance to IPSE in the structuring of renewable energy projects in Non-Interconnected Zones, and now supports the energy communities’ insular model in the localities of Isla Grande and Isla Fuerte, in the Department of Bolivar. IPSE is currently working on a project for the implementation of a hybrid solar-diesel power plant including medium and low voltage underground distribution network, for the community of Isla Grande.
GGGI is seeking a qualified service provider to provide legal, social, organizational, and financial accompaniment to the structuring of the ""Energy Communities"" model for Isla Grande and Isla Fuerte populations.

 SCOPE OF WORK;
The Service Provider shall provide expertise to develop and support the implementation of an EC model adapted to the needs of the local communities of Isla Fuerte and Isla Grande. The development of a sustainable and profitable EC model for the communities involves several key components. It requires the creation of a viable business model that outlines revenue streams, pricing strategies, and financial projections that include aspects such as energy generation, distribution, commercialization, and related services. Diversifying revenue streams through additional energy-related products is essential for financial sustainability. Identifying potential partners, particularly through a communitarian-private partnership program, is critical to establishing energy communities (ECs) on these islands while complying with national regulations and requirements for energy tariff approvals and subsidies. To ensure long-term viability, a sound financial plan shall be developed to cover capital investment, operating costs, and revenue generation.
Community engagement plays a key role by involving community members in the design and decision-making processes related to the community energy model, thus ensuring their active participation and influence in the management of the local energy provider. In addition, respecting and incorporating the cultural values and traditions of the islands into the knowledge transfer process is critical to aligning the project with the local community. Organizing knowledge-sharing events such as community events, seminars, or webinars where experts can share their knowledge and experience in renewable energy and sustainability facilitates educational outreach. Documenting the project's progress and successes as case studies is a valuable resource for other off-grid communities considering similar initiatives. Finally, training and capacity-building programs should provide community members with the skills and knowledge needed to operate and maintain renewable energy systems effectively.
In summary, the consultancy shall ensure that the EC model provided allows the adoption of a business model that guarantees sustainability in the provision of electric energy services in the islands and that the provision of the electricity service will contribute to poverty eradication, social development and to close existing gender gaps.
The development of an EC model for the islands of Isla Fuerte and Isla Grande should be focused on creating a sustainable and profitable venture while addressing the community's energy needs. Following is a brief overview of the key components:
Business Model: Develop a viable business model that outlines revenue streams, pricing strategies, and financial projections, considering factors like energy generation, distribution, commercialization, and energy-related services.

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Kazakhstan is the largest oil producer in Central Asia and a major gas producer. The CO2 intensity of Kazakhstan’s GDP is nearly 70% higher than the world average, reflecting the structure of its economy, which includes energy-intensive heavy industries. According to Kazakhstan’s latest national inventory report to the UNFCCC, energy-related emissions in 2020 accounted for around 80% of its total GHG emissions, excluding effects from land use supply needed to cover domestic demand. 
 Important environmental issues in the oil and gas sector include the flaring and venting of associated gas and fugitive methane emissions. Gas flaring, the process of burning excess gas released during oil production, wastes a potential energy source, and contributes to climate change. While much of the associated gas is used or captured, World Bank figures suggest that globally, more than 140 billion cubic meters of gas is flared annually, emitting 300 million tons of CO2. In addition to economic and environmental consequences, the practice of gas flaring also has a significant negative impact on the health of communities. In Kazakhstan, although routine flaring reportedly has been effectively eliminated in Kazakhstan, approximately 1.5 bcm was flared in 2021, according to the World Bank (WB, 2022).  According to data from the IEA’s Global Methane Tracker, oil and gas related methane emissions in Kazakhstan stood at 1.75 Mt in 2021 (IEA, 2022).
 GGGI intends to support Kazakhstan for developing National Methane Action Plan (NMAP), a policy road map for 5-years which will be helpful for the country to prioritize its action to achieve tangible benefits in a short and medium term. The NMAP will be developed with deep-drive studies, intense stakeholder consultations and international learnings to establish country’s baseline, potential of methane emission reduction, possible technology intervention, investment requirement and source of financing. The NMAP should also establish the quantitative and qualitative targets for Kazakhstan.
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
The objective is to identify an eligible firm (including consortiums) with experience in methane emission reduction and flare gas optimization in Oil & Gas Sector to develop a comprehensive NMAP, a policy road map for 5-years, which will be helpful for Kazakhstan to prioritize its action to achieve tangible benefits in a short and medium term. The Firm shall ensure that the study is in line with global standards and best practices and shall lead to bankable and scalable projects in Flare Gas Optimization in Oil & Gas sector in Kazakhstan.    
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
 Under the scope of services for this assignment the selected firm shall carry out activities given below: 
A.	Landscape analysis of Gas sector to identify challenges, gaps and opportunities for Kazakhstan Oil and Gas sector in relation to gas flaring and identification of potential projects
B.	Develop Road map for scaling up gas flaring Optimization in Kazakhstan
C.	Conduct detailed Feasibility Assessment of one of the identified Gas flaring projects   
D.	Request for Proposals (RFP) from Potential Bidders and technology providers

 PROJECT BACKGROUND:
GGGI is implementing a Waste to Resources: Improving Municipal Solid and Hazardous Waste Management in Rwanda. The initiative is a 3-year project that aims to achieve three outcomes: A) Separation and valorisation of organic and plastic waste to minimize waste landfilled at the Nduba landfill in Kigali, B) Improved collection rate and management of e-waste in Kigali and Secondary Cities, and C) Improved policy and regulatory environment and enhancement of capacity through skills development and knowledge exchange main Objective.
With waste composition generated in the City of Kigali, organic waste takes up about 80% of the total waste generated. This has been confirmed by the waste characterization study developed as part of the project and in different literature. It is high time that Rwanda invests in organic waste valorisation to address challenges associated with improper management of such waste. Among the products that can be produced include compost, organic fertilizers, which can be applied to either gardening or farming to increase crop yield. GGGI plans a pilot to valorise organic waste as part of outcome A to Nduba dumpsite. 
Operations of the pilot will validate preferred business models and other lessons for future scale and expansion. Compost is a nutrient-rich product that is a by-product of the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, in a highly exothermic process, whose high Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) content is utilised as a fertiliser and aims to reduce the disposed waste by valorisation of the organic waste.
 OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
The objective of this assignment is to identify an eligible Service Provider to Design, Build and Operation of a Bio-Waste Processing Facility.
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES:
The proposed activities for the selected bidder (Contractor) are as follows:
i.	Design and build a biowaste facility
ii.	Operate the organic waste processing facility for a period of six (6) months, sharing experience and expertise with local staff that will take over the operation. The contractor shall produce of a high-quality by-product (compost) with the potential to compete in the fertiliser market.
iii.	Provide a plan for organic waste collection and specify a source and design a biowaste processing facility with the capacity to manage biowaste decomposition and accumulation for waste as well as the storage of the compost before the recycling. The Contractor shall also be expected to advise on the best method for composting such as the in-vessel, vermicomposting, windrow, or static and aerated static piles, with clearly stated pros and cons of each, and why a specific method is suggested, with clearly defined composting period for each method. The preferred method will be the one that has impact on overall methane production and good quality of fertilizers. 
iv.	Provide detailed designs including the civil works with clearly defined structural and architectural designs accompanied by detailed BoQs, Bar Bending Schedules and a Gantt chart for the management of the implementation works. 
v.	Conduct an Environmental Management Plan (ESMP) for the facility during the implementation of the project and the post-construction phase showing proper health and safety measures and identifying any possible hazards. The post-construction phase is to include important aspects like health and safety considerations for visitors and possible education rooms with anticipated visits from learning institutions.
vi.	Finally, the Contractor shall prepare an economic feasibility analysis, with a clearly stated plan, with good market research for a sustained tariff capable of sustaining the Operations expenditure (OpEx) sufficient to operate and maintain the facility operating at maximum capacity.

The contingent valuation method (CVM) is used to estimate economic values for all kinds of ecosystem and environmental services.  CVM involves directly asking people, in a survey, how much they would be willing to pay to repair and maintain historic places of worship. The results of the survey are expected to be instrumental in guiding policy decisions, resource allocation, and community engagement strategies related to the preservation of historic places of worship.

Historic England (the Authority) uses a legacy software application (TRIM version 7) for the management of non-electronic physical records.  Physical records managed in TRIM range from documents of historical significance to business and personnel paper records.2.	TRIM has been through several iterations of product identity and original ownership since first implemented, prior to the establishment of Historic England, for English Heritage.  The version currently in service has been end of sale and out of vendor support for nearly a decade.  Historic England wishes to replace the functionality offered by TRIM through implementing a modern and fully supported digital solution that addresses operational risks and issues associated with continuing to run an obsolete and unsupported system.3.	This requirement relates solely to the management of physical records.  While it is known that some candidate digital solutions also offer such functionality, management of electronic records is not in scope and does not require discussion.Objectives and Desired Outcomes4.	Objectives of the work are:a.	The contract with the successful supplier to implement and provide the digital solution commences April 2024.b.	The solution is live by July 2024 and continues until April 2028.c.	Support and operation of the solution is transitioned to business-as-usual by Septem-ber 2024.5.	The outcomes that Historic England wishes to realise are:a.	Physical records are managed using a solution with full original vendor support until at least April 2028.b.	Historic England provides first and second-line support.  The successful supplier will provide third-line support.c.	Users are trained, familiar, and at ease with using the solution.d.	The solution enables the use of TRIM in Historic England to be discontinued and IT as-sets associated with TRIM to be decommissioned.Scope6.	Within the successful supplier’s scope in this engagement will be:a.	A digital solution to manage physical records.b.	Technical implementation of the solution.c.	Migration of data from the legacy TRIM application to the new solution.d.	Post-migration data validation.e.	Provision of user guidance and any necessary training materials.f.	Early-life support  following release to live.g.	Support for the solution for the duration of the contract period.7.	Outside of the successful supplier’s scope of work will be any decommissioning of existing IT assets. Constraints8.	Constraints on the solution are:a.	The solution must be capable of single sign-on using credentials from the Historic Eng-land Azure Active Directory.b.	The successful Tenderer must hold valid Cyber Essentials certification for the duration of the contract.c.	Data must be hosted in the UK or European Economic Area only.Assumptions9.	Assumptions made at this stage are:a.	A commercial off-the-shelf solution will meet most of Historic England’s requirements, and all those marked as mandatory, with no, or minimal, modifications.b.	Supplier support for implementation and operation will be available for the duration of the contract.c.	Classification of information stored in the solution will be no higher than OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and the successful supplier and solution will have suitable technical and procedural controls to protect this information (refer to appendix 4.3 for guidance).d.	The successful supplier will, as part of their bid, offer a service to automate and man-age the migration of all required data from TRIM to the new solution, including post-migration validation of data.Technical & Delivery Strategy10.	An ‘off the shelf’ software-as-a-service solution that benefits from standard service and support is preferred, if one can be found that satisfies all mandatory requirements.  If a suitable off-the-shelf solution cannot be found, the next preferred option will be to modify an off-the-shelf product.  Development of a bespoke software application, that would require specialist support throughout its lifetime, is the least preferred option.11.	A ‘cloud first’ approach is also preferred, rather than an ‘on prem’ solution that would require physical datacentre space, utilities, and that would transfer a significant amount of responsibility for ensuring availability and resilience of the service to Historic England operational teams.12.	Tenderers are free to propose their preferred delivery methodologies.  Once appointed, the successful supplier will deliver the service in accordance with the agreed approach.",48310000,Document creation software package,14.4091,72210000,Programming services of packaged software products,12.6401,72260000,Software-related services,10.1573,48320000,Drawing and imaging software package,9.4572,79990000,Miscellaneous business-related services,7.7183,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/historicengland/aspx/ProjectManage/265

A lot of our business is conducted through letters and papers, so being able to express a range of content through writing is essential. Some of our letters are used in legal cases, so need to adhere to certain standards. Internal board papers need to be concise and be able to outline an argument as well as being clear what the ask is of the board. Emails are still a major communication channel both internally and externally and staff need to learn how to write them concisely with clear action calls. Staff are writing for different audiences and sometimes what we write aims at different audiences with the same text. These courses need to help staff understand how different audiences like to be communicated with and how to vary one's style accordingly. Our topics are often complex, and staff need to be able to adapt their messages to the different knowledge of the audiences without feeling that they are “dumbing” down the content. Our communication needs to be clear, concise and inclusive.

IntroductionThe Middle East and North African (MENA) region faces significant challenges related to high unemployment rates. A research team, led by Moustafa Haj Youssef at Liverpool John Moores University, is embarking on a comprehensive survey project to create a unique dataset focused on labor market trends and business ownership in the MENA region. The study will encompass six countries: Egypt, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. The dataset will include a wealth of information on various socio-economic and demographic attributes of individuals, such as age, education, income, marital status, labor market outcomes, household characteristics, and parental background. Additionally, the survey will delve into respondents' work experiences, offering insights not readily available in other MENA region datasets. A section of the survey will also explore respondents' personality traits and their sense of agency in their lives, contributing valuable data that is scarce not only in the MENA region but in many other regions as well.This project aims to categorise workers into different groups, including self-employed and paid workers. Researchers plan to analyse the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of each group while considering the influence of cultural, social, religious, and institutional factors unique to the countries under study. The project will also distinguish between ""sustained self-employed"" and ""dabblers self-employed,"" a differentiation not previously explored in the MENA region. Furthermore, the research team intends to estimate the returns to education for various worker groups and capture the diversity of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic among these groups.B. The RequirementProject Objectives:•	Examine Self-Employment: Investigate self-employment in the MENA region, focusing on characteristics and the existence of distinct groups (sustainers vs. dabblers), and compare them with paid workers.•	Understand Motives for Self-Employment: Explore the motivations behind entering self-employment, with a reference to locus of control and personality traits and contrast them within different self-employed groups and employed workers.•	Estimate Returns to Education: Calculate the returns to education for various self-employed groups.•	Assess COVID-19 Impact: Understand how different worker groups were affected by the COVID-19 crisis.•	Create a Comprehensive Database: Develop a comprehensive database for future research in the MENA region.Therefore, we are seeking a market research company to conduct fieldwork and collect data through computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). The selected company should handle tasks such as outsourcing respondents, administering the questionnaire (which involves 30 to 35-minute interviews), and managing the data collection process. Regular communication with the principal investigator (PI) is essential, and all work should be subject to the PI's monitoring and approval. The sample should comprise at least 1,000 respondents per country, with some countries requiring 2,000 to 3,000 respondents based on budget considerations. In total, the study aims to gather data from a minimum of 8,000 respondents across all participating countries.Responsibilities of the Market Research Company:•	Provide daily progress reports during the data collection process.•	Implement thorough editing of all interviews received.•	Monitor correlations between specific questions to ensure data coherence.•	Conduct call-backs to rectify missing or erroneous answers that do not align with the questionnaire's flow or previous responses.•	Make informed decisions to replace illogical answers by dropping them from the sample.•	Supervise the on-site team and offer continuous training.•	Intervene if there is evidence of data collection from specific respondents (e.g., the same industry).•	Ensure diversity among respondents.•	Arrange for professional translation services as needed for the questionnaire.•	Handle data processing and tabulation.•	Script data as required.•	Continuously monitor data quality and perform robustness checks.•	Maintain regular communication with the PI.This comprehensive research endeavour seeks to provide valuable insights into labor market dynamics in the MENA region and generate a dataset that can support future research efforts.",75210000,Foreign affairs and other services,35.4658,73110000,Research services,16.8292,73210000,Research consultancy services,11.8008,79310000,Market research services,9.5134,79410000,Business and management consultancy services,6.9112,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/ljmu/aspx/ProjectManage/256

The project consortium is led by the University of Liverpool Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, in partnership with Telet Research (N.I) Ltd, Qualcomm Technologies International Ltd, Radisys UK Ltd, Attocore Ltd, iTS Technology Group, Asset Market, Liverpool John Moores University, CGA Simulation Ltd and Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Other consortium members include Liverpool 5G, Atticus Technology, the Hartree Centre, Weaver Labs and Aimes.The Liverpool City Region HDD project aims to showcase the benefits of Open RAN (Open Radio Access Network) technology in optimising real-world network performance in high-connectivity environments. Open RAN is seen as a way to enhance the UK’s connectivity infrastructure by enabling networks of low-cost, power-efficient, and unobtrusive small cells to meet the demand of high-density areas.The Liverpool City Region HDD project will test the Open RAN technology in a simulated environment before trialling it at five test bed sites across the region, including a mixture of indoor and outdoor sites with a variety of uses, to see if the new HDD network can easily, safely and securely provide connectivity to high numbers of users in the same environment. The project emphasises collaboration with national and private networks to understand their needs and encourages participation through trials in a controlled environment.The focus is on delivering competitive solutions with 5G technology and simulation, providing workable models for the adoption of Open RAN in the UK. We therefore aim to quantify and explicitly demonstrate the benefits to mobile communications markets and overcome challenges in assuring local authorities and asset owners of sustained economic and social benefits. The project team plans to showcase agile, easily managed, and secure networks in and around the Liverpool region.1.2.3	The 5G deployments Deployments at 5 venues around the Liverpool City Region including stadia and large public spaces. The deployments will be designed to sit alongside and enhance the current connectivity inside each venue and might include a number of use cases as outlined below.The O-RAN network architecture for each venue will be designed on a case by cases basis but might include different clusters of functionality depending on the focus of the testing and the needs of the venue. Below is an example of the different private networks we aim to support.  We are considering a 5G Private Network deployment with a 5G sub6 standalone core and a mix of traditional split 0 (All in One) small cells, and split7.2 small cells. The sub6 radios will provisionally aim to utilise n77, but UEs will obviously need to support a full range of 5G frequencies. We also expect some use of 26.5-27.5GHz frequencies with mmW split 0 (All in One) small cells.1.2.4	Use Case TrialsThe use case trials are still being finalised alongside the venues and their specific requirements, but we expect they will include a number of different scenarios and user equipment. A summary of our current scenarios, along with the UE requirements, is given below:-	Providing dedicated network capacity for critical operations in a venue for staff, organisers, and operations teams to support events. A range of user equipment (smartphones, tablets, etc.) would be deployed across the space and wireless connectivity will be tested in the face of challenging conditions.-	Wireless video surveillance using connected cameras. In this case, 5G-enabled cameras could be deployed dynamically, flexibly, and at scale to cover certain events. For example, to support crowd management. High bandwidth and reliable connectivity is required.-	On-demand infrastructure support for kiosks, advertisement, or POS devices. Additional wireless capacity is sometimes required to support peaks in demand during specific events. In this case, fast and reliable connectivity via mobile routers connected to a dedicated infrastructure is expected to yield new business opportunities.-	Providing dedicated capacity for heavy use areas during, for example, conferences of e-sports events would require massive coverage and intelligent management of access and bandwidth requirements. In this case, a large number of ‘typical’ user devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) would occupy a venue and connectivity must be provided during these peak hours. 1.3 	SpecificationThe specification for the user equipment required is provided below.Lot One - 5G Handsets•	2500 Android smartphones •	Must support all main 5G sub 6Ghz bands in SA mode including n78 and n77•	 Support for private PLMNIDs•	Preference for Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 or 8 series processors•	Android 13 preferable; Android 12, upgradable to Android 13 minimumLot Two - Mi-Fi 5G Routers•	300 MiFi 5G routers•	Must support all main 5G sub 6Ghz bands in SA mode including n78 and n77•	WiFi6 support•	Should support mmWave (n257/258)Lot Three - 5G CPE devices (mix of IDU and ODU)•	100 5G CPE devices•	70 indoor; including at least 4 Ethernet Ports; WiFi6 support•	30 outdoor; including at least 1 Ethernet port•	Must support all main 5G sub 6Ghz bands in SA mode including n78 and n77•	Should support mmWave (n257/258)Lot Four - 5G & mmWave Enabled Test Laptops  •	10 laptop computers •	Ultraportable upto 14in screen •	Snapdragon processor preferable •	Minimum 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD •	Support WiFi 6  •	Must support all main 5G sub 6Ghz bands in SA mode including 78 and n77 •	Should support mmWave (n257/258) Lot Five - 5G & mmWave-enabled cameras •	10 IP camera devices •	Video Resolution up to 2560x1440@25fps; Compression: H.265 •	Including 1 Ethernet port •	Must support all main 5G sub 6Ghz bands in SA mode including n78 and n77 •	Should support mmWave (n257/258) 1.4	LotsThis tender exercise consists of five Lots, as detailed above in section 1.3.

We are also open to additions to the below requirements your product solution can deliver please include these in your response to us.Please see below an overview of the project and our requirements we are looking to meet.1. Town wide Wayfinding & Creative PlacemakingStation WelcomeAt the Station visitors should be welcomed by Information Board. The Information Board outlines the landscape of Stowmarket and what is on offer during that week or month. It also includes place-based community messaging functions and links to the online Stowmarket content via QR code. We feel a simple direction, such as “head for the spire and you won’t go far wrong” might be enough in complement to existing finger posts already installed. For visitors who aren’t familiar with where they are heading, some degree of communicating progress along the route would be useful and we have suggested additional signage on the way-- or pavement way markers (i.e., York). Where the River Gipping is crossed, an information sign could provide comfort that the walker is still on the right track. But also tells them of the remarkable blue and green infrastructure that abounds in and around the town.The crossroads of Gipping Way and Station Road East and West could be improved to prioritise pedestrian movement towards the town centre where the Churchyard begins, wayfinding could be part (but not all) of the solution here. At the Churchyard the visitor is greeted by another information board welcoming them to the first key green space in Stowmarket (Project2).Car ParksThe many Stowmarket car parks are an important transition point between people’s journey into Stowmarket and continuing by foot on arrival. It is likely that people will follow the instructions of a map on their smartphone; we cannot change that. Some car park users will know exactly how to get to their destination and may only need a reminder of the best route, for some it will be their first visit; but for all – interventions should seek to offer a welcoming and reassuring dialogue through wayfinding and placemaking. In a context where people follow the recommendations of their smartphone map, the opportunity is to present an in-date Stowmarket voice with superior local know-how regarding what is on, where it is and how best to get there. We wish to appeal to people’s inherent ways of navigation. We propose overhauling typical Car Park Pay Points introducing a simple wayfinding language that then guides people on and into Stowmarket and potentially renames the Car Parks to be more suitable to the venues and destinations they serve. Signage will Identify, help navigate or orientate, and provide information. Appealing to people’s expectation for guidance. The visual language will be engaging and confident. The materially be timeless and a framework for future augmentation. To appeal to a range of audiences the visual communication should present Stowmarket’s inclusive personality. In terms of content, it should give instruction that are easy to retain and how to maintain orientation on that route. Legibility will be delivered not only through font size and contrast but through editing of information to what is deemed necessary to include. Note should be given to where level access is best achieved. To align with the intention of timelessness and flexibility any bespoke signage frames would still be defined by industry standard sizes and fixings. In hand with an overarching Stowmarket visual identity, it will be wise to accommodate in-the-moment local communication regards events, for that to feel at home rather than an unwelcome interruption. At the Food Museum car park a sculpture (03) and billboard sign scheme celebrate what is on and bring the museum into the public realm. These could be an opportunity for smart technology solutions.Inner and Outer gateways Blue and Green InfrastructureThere are four principal ways the visitor (whether new or regular) will access Stowmarket - by car, by train, by bus or by bike. We have identified the priority locations within the town (at two levels of perceived impact) where those moving at the pace of a vehicle should be communicated towards. Junctions become critical locations to show and to celebrate what is on offer at Stowmarket to the traveller who might pass by the town every day without considering what is at its centre. The most effective means of doing this at the periphery of the town would be an update to the existing billboard scheme but commissioned through a cohesive design strategy possibly under the Uncover Stowmarket brand. We also advise that existing pieces of town architecture are used through sign painting to herald a welcome to the town and a suggestion of what it has to offer. Junctions are also key moments where impressions of place are built, and it was understood from engagement that many of them are letting the town down in terms of first impressions. The Station Road / Gipping Way junction and the Crown Street roundabout are key examples where a sense of arrival at a vibrant, exciting, and plentiful place should be made. Then there are moments of transfer from one mode of transport to another, from the car to the pavement, from the train to the platform and so on. Therefore, as outlined above car parks and the station become critical gateways to extend a welcome to the visitor and the regular alike.Stowmarket has a remarkable network of blue and green infrastructure that lies very close to it’s centre. It possesses the potential to be a critical asset to the town for both the promotion of sustainable forms of travel and improving local access to nature, but also as a complementary draw for visitors from further afield visiting the Food Museum or perhaps traversing the National Cycle Route 51. The River Gipping, through the work of organisations such as the Pickerel Project, is being proven to be a critical piece of local accessible infrastructure for walking - it was noted from consultation that elements of the route were intimidating to the lone walker. Continued upkeep to its banks and providing greater means of access along its length will serve to improve this. We propose signage along its route to provide information about the initiative and encourage the visitor to explore further in the knowledge that they are going the right way. This work might be done in collaboration with the Gateway 14 Project, where the River Gipping Path could provide a green, safe, and quiet route from the station to the new free port development to the south, encouraging sustainable forms of travel and access to this ecologically ambitious business park development. There is the opportunity to create a near-contiguous green trail around the town, connected through by a more biodiverse High Street and the Market Square. The route could be signed through a simple walker focussed signage scheme and perhaps illustrated as per the work of Stow Stories - critically, the routes described on the Love Exploring app should be advertised on the information signage around the town and the green and blue networks that encircle and intertwine through Stowmarket should be celebrated and shown, such that those who are less interested in the most direct route, but perhaps the prettiest or the most enjoyable can find their way too",34920000,Road equipment,44.4912,34990000,"Control, safety, signalling and light equipment",31.4726,44420000,Goods used in construction,8.3842,31520000,Lamps and light fittings,5.2016,45230000,"Construction work for pipelines, communication and power lines, for highways, roads, airfields and railways; flatwork",2.3663,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/suffolksourcing/aspx/ProjectManage/17456

The council's target date for award of contract is March 26th, 2024, with service commencement following on May 31st, 2024. The initial contract term will be for 3 years with possibility of extending the term by a further 4 years in increments to be agreed, subject to the agreement and performance of both parties. The form of contract used will be the Council's standard terms for the supply of services. The estimated annual value of the contract is £375,000 based upon current core requirements. The value of the contract for delivery of core requirements may increase or decrease in the event of changes to specification, changes to frequencies, and removal or addition of requirements from the contract. The Council cannot provide any guarantees of increases or decreases of the contract; however, any increases will be capped at 20% of the per annum contract value. The upper value of the contract in respect of core requirements could therefore theoretically increase to £450,000 per annum. The above value estimate does not include for any non-core ad-hoc requirements such as additional support for events, specialist ad-hoc services, etc.  No accurate estimate or guarantee in respect of value for non-core ad-hoc services can be provided, but it could equate to an upper additional value of £10,000 per annum. Therefore, the full upper per annum value of the contract could theoretically equate to £460,000 if additions to score services are taken up and a high volume of non-core ad-hoc services is commissioned via the contract. The council is ideally seeking to deliver a saving through this procurement process and avoid any cost increases. Therefore, Council reserves the right to set aside any tender that exceeds £375,000 per annum for delivery of the Council's current core requirements. Tenderers, other than the current incumbent supplier, should also note that tenders will only be accepted where the tenderer can evidence that they have attended a scheduled tour of the site.

Cutting edge retinal imaging is crucial to these endeavours. Advanced retinal imaging has been at the forefront of research advances in ophthalmology; as resolution has increased, the capacity to understand disease mechanisms has advanced for all major blinding conditions. In the retina, this has advanced on two parallel fronts, firstly, improved imaging of individual retinal layers including the photoreceptor mosaic, and secondly, improved imaging of retinal vasculature and microvasculature and associated structures. At the forefront of this is the ultra-high resolution provided by adaptive optics techniques, enabling single cell resolution in vivo. To date, these various technologies are available at QUB to support clinical trials on separate instruments, necessitating long tiring visits for patients and challenges for researchers in co-registering the different imaging types to look at the same location simultaneously. In order to address some of the above issues, Queens University wishes to procure a compact, multi-modal and multi-scale retinal imaging system, with microscopic resolution capability that is able to overcome the above-mentioned issues, in combination with laser-based imaging to help with media opacities and provide confocality.The equipment will be installed at The Wellcome Trust-Wolfson Northern Ireland Clinical Research Facility (NICRF), a joint venture between Health and Social Care, Queens University, and the University of Ulster, located in Belfast City Hospital.",33110000,"Imaging equipment for medical, dental and veterinary use",38.2753,33120000,Recording systems and exploration devices,10.3149,50420000,Repair and maintenance services of medical and surgical equipment,8.6231,38510000,Microscopes,7.692,85150000,Medical imaging services,3.5313,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/queensuniversitybelfast/aspx/ProjectManage/2508

To enhance sensitivity and selectivity we require an ion mobility separation system prior to mass spectrometry analysis. To achieve this performance (i) the ion mobility system should be capable of short duty cycle (50-100 milliseconds) allowing for coordination with fast mass spectrometry acquisition methods, and crucially, short gradient chromatography for high throughput applications; (ii) to increase sensitivity the ion mobility separation system should be capable of trapping and releasing separated ion in concentrated packets; (iii) to increase ion usage efficiency the mass selective quadrupole should be capable of coordination  with the release of ions from the ion mobility system in DDA, DIA, and PRM modes of operation.

This is a cutting-edge technique whereby researchers can determine the precise location of gene expression within the tissue context. To allow us to process archival tissue samples e.g. biobanked samples, or precious samples in a cost-effective way, we require instrumentation that will allow us to create tumour microarrays (TMAs). A TMA contains many small representative tissue samples from tens to hundreds of different patient/animal samples assembled on a single histological slide, and therefore allows high throughput analysis of multiple specimens at the same time. This also enables cost-effective analysis as multiple samples can be processed on a single slide, which is important for us to offer as a core service. By purchasing such instrumentation, this would enable the GCTU to support large scale studies, increase our throughput and decrease costs for service users.To do this we require an instrument that:1)	Has changeable drills/tools that will allow us to work with both Human and Animal tissues in line with HTA requirements.2)	Being able to process a large number of blocks (>70) per run to ensure maximal number of sample cores can be included per TMA and offer access to our service for high throughput projects such as those involving biobanked samples.3)	Minimal consumable requirements to keep costs low for operation.4)	Minimal service requirements to reduce system down time.5)	Ability to capture cores in PCR tubes, rather than recipient block, for additional downstream usage flexibility such as next-generation sequencing and/or qPCR studies.",38430000,Detection and analysis apparatus,39.2362,38950000,Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment,23.5384,51430000,Installation services of laboratory equipment,4.5433,38540000,Machines and apparatus for testing and measuring,3.8879,38510000,Microscopes,2.8613,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/queensuniversitybelfast/aspx/ProjectManage/2504

Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council wishes to appoint a single Provider to the ASC113 Trusted Assessor Service to provide assessments for eligible individuals ready for discharge from hospital in Sandwell.People can sometimes wait too long for discharge from hospital resulting in poor experience of the health and care system and poorer outcomes. Trusted Assessor schemes are a national initiative designed to reduce delays when people are ready for discharge from hospital. Providers accept assessments carried out by suitably qualified ‘Trusted Assessors’ working under formal, written agreements.Research has shown that delayed discharges can have a significant negative impact on people’s well-being. There are also risks associated with premature or poorly planned discharges.The use of a Trusted Assessor Service can reduce the numbers and waiting times of people awaiting discharge from hospital and help them to move from hospital back home or to another setting speedily, effectively and safely thereby improving patient experience, clinical safety and patient flow.The Service will operate 7 days a week. The Specification, attached as Appendix 2 to the Invitation to Tender, details the aims of the service to be provided within the contract and the connections to other services in the community. The Provider will be required to provide a high-quality service that aligns with the Council’s vision for Adult Social Care.The Trusted Assessor Service Agreement will commence on 1st April 2024 for an initial period of 2 years with the option of extending for up to a further 12 months.Suitably qualified and experienced persons and organisations can view the full tender documentation that includes the Invitation to Tender, which contains details of the evaluation criteria and methodology, and Tender Response Documents; detailed Specification(s) and a copy of the Council’s standard Terms and Conditions of Agreement by registering on Sandwell’s In-Tend Supplier Portal.

Many of whom continue to live in fear of their perpetrator tracking them down to their new accommodation, which may lead to further episodes of homelessness. Those who make the decision to be re-housed often have to leave their possessions behind and risk losing contact with or weakening their support network. Nationally domestic abuse is a leading reason for women’s homelessness and is consistently within the top three reasons for homelessness in Solihull.  During the period 01.10.22 - 30.09.23, domestic abuse accounted for 22% of all main duty homelessness acceptances in Solihull. This equates to 43 individuals/families. In addition, 12% of the total number of households approaching the homelessness service in 2022-23 gave domestic abuse as the main reason for approach. This equated to over 100 individuals / families.Refuge and other temporary accommodation can provide a safe space for households that are at risk, however many victims do not want to leave their homes or would like to return to their home after a stay in temporary accommodation. Interventions that improve the physical security of the family home are evidenced as good practice (CLG 2010)  and can give some victims a realistic opportunity to remain in their home. Commonly these are called ‘Sanctuary’.  The Homeless Reduction Act (2017) introduced new duties on local authority homelessness services to prevent homelessness and provide support to those at risk of homelessness and the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 places a statutory duty on Local Authorities to provide domestic abuse safe accommodation. Both pieces of legislation require local authorities to develop interventions which will enable households at risk due to domestic abuse, to have access to safe accommodation. Sanctuary schemes are recognised as having a role to play in delivering the requirements of both duties, as they give victims/survivors a choice to remain in their property. Solihull Sanctuary is one part of a multi-agency response to households at risk of domestic violence and is delivered alongside wider support to the household. It is one element of the Solihull’s ‘Housing Pathway: Victims of Domestic Abuse’. Prevention and protection from domestic abuse are key themes in the Solihull Domestic Abuse Strategy.Target hardening is used to describe the improvement of the security of a property to reduce the risk of crime from a sanctuary perspective, the aim is to make the survivor/s of domestic abuse feel safer as well as to reduce the risk of the perpetrator accessing the home. There are currently two levels of support available depending on the level of risk posed by the perpetrator and taking into account the individual circumstances of the household.The physical improvements to the security of the building are always carried out in conjunction with an offer of support through an Independent Domestic Abuse Housing Advocate. This can then become DA Safe Accommodation in line with new DA legislation.The incumbent provider has been delivering a Target Hardening Service as part of the Solihull Sanctuary since April 2021. Previously the target hardening service was delivered by Solihull Community Housing. Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC) is now looking to commission delivery of the Target Hardening Service to an independent specialist for an initial 2-year period from 01.05.24.",85310000,Social work services,16.17,79410000,Business and management consultancy services,11.9564,85320000,Social services,9.0242,71310000,Consultative engineering and construction services,7.3217,45210000,Building construction work,3.9318,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/csw-jets/aspx/ProjectManage/18263

Benefits-related free school meals (referred to as FSM) are available to pupils if their parents are in receipt of one of the qualifying benefits and have a claim verified by their Local Authority. As of November 2023, there were 9665 children who attend a Solihull school, registered as FSM from Reception to Year 11.Providers are asked to ensure that the offer of free holiday club provision is available for all children in receipt of FSM in their area, though this does not mean we expect all to attend as the provision is voluntary.All children in reception, year 1 and year 2 in England’s state-funded schools receive a free meal under the Department for Education’s universal infant free school mean (UIFSM) policy. Infant pupils who receive a free meal under UIFSM must also be eligible for benefits-related FSM to be able to access a place on the HAF programme.This FCA broadly covers:1. ActivitiesEnrichment activitiesHoliday clubs must provide fun and enriching activities that provide children with opportunities to:• develop new skills or knowledge• consolidate existing skills and knowledge• try out new experiences• have fun and socialiseThis could include but is not limited to:• physical activities, for example, football, swimming, table tennis or cricket• creative activities, for example, putting on a play, junk modelling or drumming workshops• experiences, for example, a nature walk or visiting a city farm• free play, for example, fun and freedom to relax and enjoy themselvesPhysical activitiesHoliday clubs must provide activities that meet the physical activity guidelines on a daily basis. In line with those guidelines, we expect:• All children and young people participating in the HAF programme should engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for an average of at least 60 minutes per day. It should be noted that this does not have to be in the form of a structured activity session, but can include active travel, free play and sports.• Children and young people participating in the HAF programme should engage in a variety of types and intensities of physical activity to develop movement skills, muscular fitness, and bone strength.• Children and young people should aim to minimise the amount of time spent being sedentary, and when physically possible should break up long periods of not moving with at least light physical activity.2. Food ProvisionThe requirement is that at least one meal a day (breakfast, lunch or tea) is given per four-hour session (For providers who are unable to supply food then please see section 3.7). All food provided at the holiday club (including snacks) must meet school food standards. Our expectation is that the majority of food served by providers should be hot, however, we acknowledge that there will be exceptional circumstances when this is not possible and cold food should be used where it is appropriate.3. Nutritional EducationProviders must include an element of nutritional education each day aimed at improving the knowledge and awareness of healthy eating for children.

As part of this quality and compliance review we need to ensure that the decisions we are making are the right ones, and that individuals and families who approach as homeless / at risk of homeless receive an excellent service, and one that takes into account their personal needs and circumstances. SMBC previously commissioned the National Practitioner Support Service (NPSS) to carry out external case file audits. On a quarterly basis, NPSS carried out a desk top review of all cases on Housing Jigsaw and looked in-depth at two cases per officer. The 360-degree reviews looked at the cases from the customer but also in relation to legislation, statutory duty, and from a case management perspective. Cases were a mixture of prevention, relief and main duty. After the audits a training session was arranged with Managers at SCH / St. Basils, and SMBC commissioners, to review findings and focus on recommendations.NPSS ceased trading in November 2020 and there is a need to commission an alternative organisation to carry out the case file audits. In January 2022 the SMBC audit team carried out an audit on a smaller sample of case files but are not able to provide this service on an on-going basis.  Solihull Community Housing and St. Basils already have an internal audit system which reviews cases in line with legislation. Every three months Team Leaders look at a percentage of case for the officers they support and capture feedback through a standardised case management checklist. The checklist is designed to cover all key areas in the assessment and case management process. Management staff have previously found external case file audits useful not just in identifying areas for improvement, but in identifying areas that were done well so that this good practice could be shared with the team.

HSE is designated as the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority (AALA) in GB. The Adventure Activities Licensing Authority (AALA) is administered by HSE’s Local Authority and Safety Unit (LASU).  LASU sits within HSE’s Operational Strategy Branch.  LASU's Entertainment Leisure, Commercial and Consumer Services Sector team provides the policy lead on health and safety within the adventure activity sector, regardless of whether HSE or the Local Authority is the enforcing authority.  The AALA was created following the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy in March 1993. The MP for Plymouth Devonport, who represented the parents of those who died, introduced a Private Member's Bill, which became the Activity Centres (Young Persons’ Safety) Act 1995. Tourism Quality Services (TQS) was the original AALA, until responsibility was transferred to HSE in 2007 however HSE contracted TQS to continue to operate the service on its behalf. From then TQS were formally known as the Adventure Activities Licensing Service (AALS).  The Adventure Activities Licensing Regulations, created under the 1995 Act, apply to four groups of outdoor activities only: caving, climbing, trekking and water sports. These are defined in the Regulations.The Contractor, on behalf of the AALA, is under contract to inspect providers of licensable activities and make a judgement on their suitability to hold a license, in accordance with the legislation. The Contractor will adhere to the requirements of Regulation 6 (a) of the Regulations and only award licenses to applicants who meet the necessary criteria.The aim of adventure activities licensing is to provide assurances to the public that activity providers who hold a license have demonstrated that they have suitable safety management systems in place to manage risk. The aim being that young people can enjoy exciting and stimulating activities outdoors without being exposed to avoidable risks of death or disabling injury.HSE was designated as AALA from 1 April 2007, and retained the existing operators to manage the day-to-day operation of the service until 2020, when administration of the system was brought in-house.

There is a requirement for the ability to install multiple WordPress sites with the facility to allow a multisite system on a WordPress site where needed. The University of Northampton existing managed hosting contract is due to expire and so are seeking a managed WordPress hosting service from Spring 2024.

The hosting service will be required to host several WordPress sites, including a Restaurant site, Hotel Site, a Blog site with multi-sites enabled, Virtual Tour and the main University public website which runs multi sub-sites for areas of the university which require a public facing website.   The main University public website had over 3 million visitors in the last year and so the successful tenderer will need to be able to handle peaks of high activity/traffic.  Also, the successful tenderer will need to provide 24 hours per day monitoring of the public website ensuring issues can be detected and resolved quickly.  Over the period of the contract the University’s AV, Digital and collaborative tools Team will also be moving websites, microsites and blogs which are used elsewhere within the university to the hosting solution.  This will include having multi-site enabled for some sites so that microsites and blogs can sit under their respective sites.  An example of this is Awards and Module catalogue ( https://www.northampton.ac.uk/awards/ ) currently sitting under the public website ( https://www.northampton.ac.uk/ ) installation.

There will be a requirement to create further instances of WordPress.  There is also an expectation that any new hosting supplier will provide project management and resources to migrate the University off the existing platform and hosting arrangement and on to the new hosting provider in time for contract expiry which is the 21st May 2024.

Within the ‘Fully Automated Layup and consolidation cell’ the Press will sit alongside a variety of other equipment, and will be in close proximity to the following:-•	High Volume Deposition Cell – including Robot arms and guide rails;•	Press Heater System;•	Press Injection System;•	Oven Feed table.The Press is to be used for manufacturing research into the production of large polymer composite components using several potential processes, including (but not limited to):-•	Dry fibre pre-forming;•	Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM);•	Gap RTM/ Infusion;•	Wet Compression Moulding and Compression Moulding of pre-preg. Brief Summary of RequirementsPlease see G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5 for our exact technical and functional requirements, however at a high level these can be summarised as:-•	The Press will have cold platens and that any heating for processing will be applied to the tooling rather than through the platens. A system of automated tool clamping, and location will need to be included within the tendered press platen package.•	The Press is expected to have a stroke of a minimum of 1500mm within the minimum daylight of 2.3m.•	The Press is required to have a moving lower platen that will enter and exit along the long axis from one end only. All controls and connections for the lower tool will remain active when the lower platen is fully extracted from the press.•	The AMRC is looking for flexibility in the size of tooling that can be used within the Press. The maximum size of component is defined for the purpose of this specification as 10m (length) x 3m (width) x 1.5m (depth) and this will require a minimum programmable force of up to 8 bar across the entire area of that part. Cost options for an incremental increase of this force up to 20 bar are requested (if possible).•	It is anticipated that the platens’ size will exceed the maximum component size by approx. 0.5m in the X and Y axes (10.5m x 3.5m) to accommodate a part of 10m x 3m. To this end the tenderer is expected to recommend a suitable platen size within its proposal.•	The Press must be able to control the platens in a way that allows for tools shorter than the full length to be safely used. The limits to this function must be stated within your tender response.•	The Press will be expected to maintain the platens in an accurate Z plane whilst holding a full-sized tool open against a tool internal vacuum.•	The Press must be capable of monitoring and controlling forces during both closing and opening operations, this control will have set limits in both directions.•	The Press control system must should be capable of controlling additional functions, such as hydraulic actuators, ejectors, or tool features. •	The Press will require an on-board integrated high performance vacuum system for tool vacuum with a full control capability from the Press control. This system should be capable of creating and maintaining a closed tool vacuum level down to better than 0.1mbar.•	The Press will need to control the heating and cooling of a loaded tool, as part of an automated process cycle. Tooling utilised within the press will be heated to a maximum of 220°C.•	The Press will be contained within a fully automated manufacturing cell demonstrator, and as such will need to be integrated into an overall cell control system. This integration specification will require some discussion with the selected suppliers following completion of the tender process.•	Safety features and mechanical interlocks to allow the cleaning of tools in the upper platen to be included in the supply of the Press. The Press must lock open by a mechanism that will remain operational despite loss of power to the Press.•	Access to the Press for cleaning purposes and application of release agent with the ability to stand under the upper tool needs to be included in your tender response.•	Safety Systems to EU (CE) and/or UKCA standards.•	A comprehensive Press Control SystemFor this reason, the Press is expected to have significant flexibility in its range of use and application, unlike a more dedicated production solution.Tender Process and Documentation:This procurement is an open procedure.The ITT can be downloaded by registering and expressing your interest on the University`s e-tendering system https://in-tendhost.co.uk/SheffieldIf you have any questions or comments in relation to this tender they must be submitted via the In-tend System, this can be accessed at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/SheffieldCompleted tenders must be returned through the same e-tendering system.Closing date for receipt of tenders: Friday 22nd September 2023 at 12 noon (UK time).",42630000,Metal-working machine tools,47.7946,42610000,Machine tools operated by laser and machining centres,12.6731,42990000,Miscellaneous special-purpose machinery,12.6585,42960000,"Command and control system, printing, graphics, office automation and information-processing equipment",3.992,42620000,"Lathes, boring and milling machine tools",2.4788,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/sheffield/aspx/ProjectManage/3488

The initiative is to simplify what is a complicated working environment which is not helped by the current configuration and associated business processes within the MS Dynamics system.  The MS Dynamics CRM system in use by GR&A is the only system available for the recording, management and reporting of a significant volume of pre-application activity with prospective students. As a Tier 1 business-critical system, it supports all facets of university student recruitment and outreach. From application onwards, enquiries are still managed in the CRM system, however the application process and student record management is achieved with a different system, that is integrated into the CRM. It is the critical data repository and communication tool that enables the management of all  pre-application activity; including handling enquiries, prospectus requests, event record management (both in person and digital), Clearing interest, and enabling proactive and continued engagement with potential students through scheduled and personalised marketing email communications, all designed to ensure Reading is seen as a desirable University destination and drive applications across all levels of study, from UK and overseas students. As a master record of all pre-application activity, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM system is also a critical tool in measuring the impact of our recruitment efforts, most notably through the integration with our system containing application data to show return on investment through the resulting recruitment pipeline. Over a 15-month cycle, team members from GR&A manage engagement with 45,000-50,000 leads (prospective students) within the CRM system, across Undergraduate, Postgraduate (Teaching and Research), International Foundation and Pre-sessional programmes. In addition, the CRM system is also critical for supporting longer term engagement with students looking for entry in future years, recording initiatives committed to as part of our Access and Participation plan and communicating with parents and other stakeholders in the University application journey, such as teachers and international agents.",72210000,Programming services of packaged software products,23.8401,48440000,Financial analysis and accounting software package,18.0461,72260000,Software-related services,13.0853,72220000,Systems and technical consultancy services,4.4587,72230000,Custom software development services,4.2649,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/theuniversityofreading/aspx/ProjectManage/1844
